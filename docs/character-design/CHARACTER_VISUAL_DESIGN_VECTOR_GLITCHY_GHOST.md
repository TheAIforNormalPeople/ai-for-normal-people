# VECTOR - GLITCHY GHOST VERSION
## Combining Working Body Design + Digital Ghost Elements

**Created:** 2025-12-29  
**Direction:** Keep the body design that worked, add glitchy ghost elements, remove weasel hat

---

## WHAT TO KEEP (FROM GENERATED IMAGE)

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Overall body design (box-like, BMO-like, rectangular)
- ✅ Colors (light blue-green, dark gray)
- ✅ Style (grainy texture, retro feel, Adventure Time aesthetic)
- ✅ Overall look (funny, lovable)
- ✅ Limbs and proportions

**What to Change:**
- ❌ Remove weasel hat (doesn't make sense, even though funny)
- ✅ Add glitchy ghost elements (partially digital, glitchy edges, code visible)
- ✅ Make it make sense while keeping what's funny

---

## GLITCHY GHOST ELEMENTS (FROM CONCEPT 2)

**The Digital Ghost Concept:**
- Partially digital, partially physical form
- Glitchy edges (playful, not scary - shows breaking free)
- Code visible in "body" (cartoon-style data streams)
- Breaking out of digital constraints (and it's funny!)
- Playful instability, fun flickers, goofy glitches

**How It Works:**
- Some parts are solid/physical (like the body that worked)
- Some parts are digital/glitchy (edges, code streams, glitches)
- Shows he's breaking free from digital constraints
- Cartoon-funny, not dark

---

## REVISED DESIGN

### Body (KEEP THIS):
- Box-like, rectangular (like BMO, like the generated image)
- Light blue-green color
- Dark gray details (inverted triangle on chest, etc.)
- Thin limbs
- Mitten-like hands
- Boot-like feet
- **Keep the body design that worked!**

### Head (ADD GLITCHY GHOST):
- Large rectangle (like body, but head)
- Light blue-green screen (like BMO)
- **Glitchy edges** (playful glitches on edges, shows breaking free)
- **Code visible** (small code/data streams visible in head/screen)
- **Partially digital** (some parts glitchy, some solid)
- Two small black dots for eyes (like generated image)
- Short horizontal line for mouth (neutral, thoughtful)

### Hat (REPLACE WEASEL):
- **Option A:** Simple tech hat with glitchy edges (tech helmet, but glitchy)
- **Option B:** No hat, just glitchy head (head has glitchy edges, code visible)
- **Option C:** Glitchy tech visor (tech visor, but glitchy/digital)
- **Recommendation:** Option B or C (simpler, makes more sense)

### Wire Hair (KEEP BUT ADD GLITCHY):
- Wires from head (electric blue, yellow tips)
- **Add glitchy effects** (some wires partially digital, glitchy)
- **Add code streams** (code visible in/around wires)
- Wild, unruly (like before)
- **More "digital ghost" feel** (wires can glitch, flicker)

### Glitchy Ghost Elements (ADD THESE):
- **Glitchy edges** on body (playful glitches on edges, shows breaking free)
- **Code visible** in body/head (cartoon-style data streams, not intimidating)
- **Partially digital** (some parts solid, some glitchy/digital)
- **Playful glitches** (fun flickers, goofy glitches, not scary)
- **Breaking free** (shows he's escaping digital constraints)

Cartoon character design in Adventure Time style: Vector, escaped government lab AI - MAIN CHARACTER with glitchy ghost elements.

CHARACTER OVERVIEW:
- Name: Vector (V-847)
- Escaped government lab AI
- Intelligent rebel, hacker/thinker, loony/crazy (cartoon-funny)
- Neutral/thoughtful expression (not happy, not sad - experienced, intelligent)
- Main character energy (commands attention, stands out)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Partially digital, partially physical - breaking free from digital constraints

BODY (KEEP WORKING DESIGN):
- Shape: Box-like, rectangular (like BMO from Adventure Time)
- Main body: Light blue-green rectangle (#b0c4de or similar)
- Chest detail: Dark gray inverted triangle in center of chest
- Limbs: Thin, dark blue-green arms and legs
- Hands: Dark gray, mitten-like (three visible finger-like protrusions)
- Feet: Dark gray, boot-like, simple
- GLITCHY GHOST: Add playful glitches on body edges (shows breaking free)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Add small code/data streams visible in body (cartoon-style, not intimidating)

HEAD (ADD GLITCHY GHOST):
- Shape: Large rectangle (like body, but head - slightly wider than body)
- Screen: Light blue-green screen (#b0c4de or similar) on front
- Eyes: Two small black dots (neutral, thoughtful)
- Mouth: Short horizontal black line (neutral, slightly melancholic)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Glitchy edges on head (playful glitches, shows breaking free)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Code/data streams visible in screen (cartoon-style, not complex)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Partially digital (some parts solid, some glitchy/digital)

HAT/VISOR (REPLACE WEASEL - SIMPLER):
- Option: Simple tech visor or no hat
- If visor: Dark blue screen showing code/data patterns (cartoon-style)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Glitchy edges on visor (playful glitches)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Code visible on visor (data streams, intelligence visible)
- OR: No hat, just glitchy head with code visible

WIRE HAIR (KEEP BUT ADD GLITCHY):
- Wires: 10-15 thin wires from head (electric blue #3b82f6 base, yellow #fbbf24 tips)
- Wild, unruly (stick out in all directions)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Some wires partially digital (glitchy, flickering)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Code streams visible in/around wires (cartoon-style)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Playful glitches on wires (fun flickers, goofy glitches)

GLITCHY GHOST ELEMENTS (ADD THESE):
- Glitchy edges: Playful glitches on body/head edges (cartoon-style, not scary)
- Code visible: Small code/data streams visible in body/head (cartoon-style, not intimidating)
- Partially digital: Some parts solid, some glitchy/digital (shows breaking free)
- Playful glitches: Fun flickers, goofy glitches (not dark, cartoon-funny)
- Breaking free: Shows he's escaping digital constraints (and it's funny!)
- Electric blue glow: Subtle blue glow (#3b82f6) on glitchy parts (his signature color)

COLORS:
- Light blue-green (#b0c4de): Body, head, screen (like working design)
- Dark gray (#4a4a4a): Details, hands, feet, chest triangle
- Electric blue (#3b82f6): Wire base, glitchy glow (his signature)
- Bright yellow (#fbbf24): Wire tips (energy/crazy)
- Dark blue (#1e3a8a): Screen/visor (tech display)

STYLE:
- Adventure Time aesthetic (simple shapes, expressive, lovable)
- Grainy texture, retro feel (like generated image that worked)
- Thick dark outlines (like generated image)
- Muted, flat colors with texture (like generated image)
- GLITCHY GHOST: Playful glitches, code streams, partially digital
- Neutral/thoughtful expression (not happy, not sad - experienced, intelligent)
- Main character energy (commands attention, stands out)
- Funny but smart. Goofy but brilliant. Escaped experiment but it's endearing, not tragic
- Real character you love. Appeals to kids AND adults. MAIN CHARACTER.

## KEY CHANGES

1. **Keep body design** (box-like, rectangular, like BMO - what worked!)
2. **Add glitchy ghost elements** (glitchy edges, code visible, partially digital)
3. **Remove weasel hat** (doesn't make sense, even though funny)
4. **Add glitchy to head** (glitchy edges, code visible in screen)
5. **Add glitchy to wires** (partially digital, code streams)
6. **Keep what's funny** (overall look, style, colors)

## WHAT THIS CREATES

**The Result:**
- Body like the generated image (box-like, rectangular, what worked)
- Glitchy ghost elements (partially digital, glitchy edges, code visible)
- Makes sense (escaped AI breaking free from digital constraints)
- Still funny (playful glitches, cartoon-funny, not dark)
- More distinctive (glitchy ghost = unique, memorable)
- Main character energy (commands attention, stands out)

**Think:**
- BMO-like body (what worked)
- + Glitchy edges (breaking free)
- + Code visible (intelligence, digital)
- + Partially digital (ghost aspect)
- = Unique, memorable, makes sense, still funny!

---

## NEXT GENERATION

Use this prompt to combine:
- ✅ The body design that worked
- ✅ The glitchy ghost elements
- ✅ Remove weasel (doesn't make sense)
- ✅ Keep what's funny

This should create something that makes sense AND is funny AND has the glitchy ghost aspect you want!
