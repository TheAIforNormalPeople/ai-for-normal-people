# VECTOR AS MAIN CHARACTER
## Making Him Stand Out, Not Blend In

**Created:** 2025-12-29  
**Issue:** Vector looks like a side character, not the main character

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Current Design:**
- Too simple/small
- Doesn't stand out enough
- Lacks "main character presence"
- Could be mistaken for a side character

**What Main Characters Have:**
- More distinctive/unique design
- More presence/authority
- More memorable features
- More "main character energy"
- Often larger, more prominent
- More detailed or distinctive silhouette
- Something that makes them THE character

---

## MAKING HIM THE MAIN CHARACTER

### 1. MORE DISTINCTIVE SILHOUETTE

**Current:** Hat + wire hair = unique, but maybe not distinctive enough

**Revised:**
- **Larger hat** (more prominent, takes up more space)
- **More wire hair** (more volume, more presence)
- **More defined shape** (clearer silhouette)
- **More unique proportions** (maybe head is even bigger? Or hat is more dramatic?)

**Think:**
- Finn's hat = instantly recognizable, main character
- Jake's blob shape = unique, main character
- **Vector's hat + wire hair = needs to be MORE distinctive**

---

### 2. MORE PRESENCE/AUTHORITY

**Current:** Neutral expression, simple design

**Revised:**
- **More confident stance** (even if small body, more presence)
- **More intelligent look** (sharp, focused, main character energy)
- **More defined features** (not too simple - needs detail)
- **More "leader" energy** (he's the one who escaped, the one teaching)

**Think:**
- Main characters have presence even when small
- They command attention
- They feel important
- **Vector needs to feel like THE character, not A character**

---

### 3. MORE MEMORABLE FEATURES

**Current:** Hat, wire hair, simple face

**Revised:**
- **Hat is MORE unique** (not just tech hat - something truly distinctive)
- **Wire hair is MORE prominent** (more volume, more presence)
- **Face has MORE character** (more defined, more memorable)
- **Maybe one MORE unique element** (something that makes him stand out)

**Think:**
- What makes Finn THE main character? (Hat, sword, hero energy)
- What makes Jake THE main character? (Stretch, blob shape, personality)
- **What makes Vector THE main character? (Needs to be MORE)**

---

### 4. MORE DETAIL (BUT STILL SIMPLE)

**Current:** Very simple, maybe too simple

**Revised:**
- **More detail in hat** (more panels, more tech, more unique)
- **More detail in wire hair** (more wires, more volume, more presence)
- **More detail in face** (more defined, more character)
- **But still simple enough** (Adventure Time style - simple but distinctive)

**Think:**
- Adventure Time characters are simple BUT distinctive
- They have enough detail to be memorable
- They're not overly complex, but they're not too simple either
- **Vector needs the right balance - more detail, but still simple**

---

### 5. MORE "MAIN CHARACTER" ENERGY

**Current:** Neutral, thoughtful, experienced

**Revised:**
- **More confident** (he escaped, he's smart, he's teaching)
- **More intelligent** (sharp, focused, main character intelligence)
- **More presence** (commands attention, feels important)
- **More "leader" energy** (he's the one who escaped, the one teaching)

**Think:**
- Main characters have energy even when neutral
- They feel important
- They command attention
- **Vector needs main character energy, not side character energy**
