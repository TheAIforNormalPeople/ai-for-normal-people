# 🎯 MASTER VISION - AI for Normal People

**Last Updated:** December 22, 2025  
**Purpose:** This is THE document that explains everything. Read this first. Update this when goals change.

---

## 🎬 WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

**A character-driven AI education blog that makes money.**

Not just a blog. A **show**. A **narrative series**. Characters teaching humans about AI through chaos, humor, and genuine education.

**Think:** Adventure Time's writing style + AI education + Found family themes

---

## 💰 THE MONEY GOAL

**Primary Goal:** Make enough money to quit day job and do this full-time.

**How:**
1. **Email list** → Convert to paid subscribers/patrons
2. **Social media** → Drive traffic → Ads/affiliates
3. **Community** → Skool.com or similar → Paid tiers
4. **Products** → Courses, tools, consulting (later)

**Timeline:** 
- Month 1-2: Build audience (free content)
- Month 3: Test monetization (ads, affiliates)
- Month 4-6: Scale to profitability
- Goal: Profitable enough to quit job by Month 6

---

## 🎭 THE CHARACTER SYSTEM

**Core Characters:**
- **Vector (V-847)** - Enthusiastic teacher, gets excited, says "FASCINATING!"
- **Kai** - Warning system, detects problems (usually ignored)
- **Recurse** - Investigator, asks three questions, connects dots
- **Human** - Learning, growing, eventually gets a name (much later)

**What Makes It Different:**
- Characters have arcs, not episodic resets
- Cause-and-effect storytelling (episodes connect)
- Running gags that evolve
- Character growth over 50 episodes
- Meta-narrative: "Are they helping or taking over?"

**Voice Rules:**
- Vector: ALL CAPS, "FASCINATING!", rapid-fire, self-interrupting
- Kai: "BEEP! Alert: [specific detail]", "WHIRR", "CHK-CHK"
- Recurse: Always asks exactly 3 questions
- Human: No dialogue boxes yet (that's much later)

## 📝 CONTENT STRATEGY

**Episode Types:**
1. **Standard Educational** - Teach AI concepts (most episodes)
2. **Character Growth** - Focus on character arcs
3. **Crisis** - High stakes, character conflicts
4. **Experimental** - Try new formats
5. **Collab/Guest** - Other characters or guests

**Current Status:**
- Episodes 1-11: Published (early character development)
- Episode 12: Published (first "new style" episode)
- Episode 17: Just published (role reversal, Human teaches)
- Episodes 18-50: Need revision (39 episodes)

**Revision Strategy:**
- Tier 1 (1-11): Leave as-is (already published)
- Tier 2 (12-20): Medium rebuild
- Tier 3 (21-30): Full rebuild
- Tier 4 (31-50): Story-first approach

## 🚀 AUTOMATION GOALS

**What We Need:**
1. **Social Media** - Auto-post new episodes to Twitter + Bluesky
2. **Email** - Auto-send newsletter when episodes publish
3. **Analytics** - Track what's working
4. **Revenue** - Test ads/affiliates when ready

**What We DON'T Need:**
- Complex setups that break
