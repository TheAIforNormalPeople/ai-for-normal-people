You&amp;rsquo;re not alone in that. Many folks think it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of super-intelligent overlord just waiting to take over. It&amp;rsquo;s a common belief, and honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s fueled by sensationalism. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: AI is just a tool. Like any tool, it reflects the intentions of its users.&lt;/p&gt;

The real issue lies in how we use AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[Why does AI feel scary? For many, it's like standing at the edge of a dark abyss.
