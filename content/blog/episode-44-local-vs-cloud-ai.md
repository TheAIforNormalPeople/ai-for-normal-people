**[Human]:** *Should I run AI locally or use cloud services? I keep hearing different opinions.*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Emphatic*

Run it locally. Your data stays on your machine. No corporate monitoring. No usage caps. Complete control.

*Flips through privacy comparison*

With cloud AI, every query you make is logged, analyzed, potentially used for training. You're the product.

*Argues*

But local models are WEAKER! GPT-4 vs some 7B parameter model you can run on a laptop? Not even close!

*Frustrated*

Yes there's privacy, but at what cost? Worse results, harder to use, constant tinkering?

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing both arguments*

Cost comparison:
- Local: $0/month, one-time hardware/download
- Cloud: $20/month, unlimited access

Capability comparison:
- Local: 70% as capable, 100% private
- Cloud: 100% capable, 70% private (at best)

*Pauses*

The correct answer is: it depends on your threat model and needs.

**[Human]:** *So which should I choose?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

Choose local if:
- Privacy is critical
- You have sensitive data
- You want complete control
- You're okay with weaker models

*Flips notes*

Choose cloud if:
- You need best performance
- Privacy is less critical
- You want convenience
- You don't want to manage infrastructure

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Thoughtful*

And you can use both! Local for sensitive stuff, cloud for everything else!

*Gets practical*

Hybrid approach: Local models for privacy-sensitive tasks, cloud for everything else.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Most people don't need local AI. Cloud is fine for most use cases.

*Pauses*

But if you're handling sensitive information, local makes sense.

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: it depends on your needs?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly. Privacy vs convenience vs capability. Pick your priorities.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Agrees*

And you're not locked into one choice. Use what makes sense for each task.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

The answer is nuanced. As it should be.
