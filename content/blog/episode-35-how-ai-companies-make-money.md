**[Human]:** *ChatGPT Plus is $20/month. Claude Pro is $20/month. There are millions of users. These companies must be making a fortune, right?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Explains*

Well, they have revenue streams! Subscriptions, API access, enterprise deals!

*Gets excited*

It's a new market! They're building infrastructure! Of course it's expensive now, but as they scale—

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating*

Something's fishy about these valuations.

*Flips through financial reports*

Let me show you what I found.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing financial data*

OpenAI's estimated costs:
- Compute for ChatGPT: $700,000/day
- Staff: massive
- Training runs: billions per model

Revenue:
- Plus subscriptions: ~$200M/year
- API: ~$300M/year (estimated)

*Pauses*

They're burning approximately $5 billion per year.

Microsoft's investment: $13 billion.

At this rate... 2.6 years until that runs out.

Either revenue increases dramatically, costs decrease significantly, or...

*Trails off*

The math is concerning.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Wait, they're losing money?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Defensive*

It's a new market! Infrastructure costs are high! They're investing in the future!

*Gets less confident*

But... yes. Most AI companies are losing money right now.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating further*

And the valuations don't make sense. Companies worth billions, losing millions per day.

*Flips notes*

Either investors think this will change dramatically, or... something else is going on.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Cost breakdown:

Compute: 70% of costs. Every query costs money. More users = more costs, not necessarily more profit.

Training: 20% of costs. One-time per model, but models keep getting bigger.

Staff: 10% of costs. But growing.

*Pauses*

The fundamental problem: AI is expensive to run. More usage = more costs. That's not a sustainable business model without massive scale or price increases.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So how long can they keep doing this?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Thoughtful*

Depends on investor patience. If they think AI will become cheaper or more valuable, they'll keep funding losses.

*Gets serious*

But if costs don't come down or revenue doesn't go up... eventually the money runs out.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating*

Or they pivot. Enterprise deals. Higher prices. Data collection. Advertising.

*Flips notes*

Something has to change. The current model isn't sustainable.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*WHIRR*

I've analyzed three scenarios:

Scenario 1: Costs decrease 50% (unlikely in short term)
Scenario 2: Prices increase 300% (users leave)
Scenario 3: Revenue model changes (enterprise, data, ads)

*Pauses*

Most likely: Some combination. Prices go up. Enterprise becomes focus. Free tier gets more limited.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: AI companies are expensive to run, and the current model might not last?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly. Enjoy the current prices while they last. They're probably subsidized by investors.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Closes notes*

And don't assume they'll stay this way. The economics will force changes.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

The math is clear. Something has to give.
