- **Aesthetic:** Neon amber gradients, fluid motion, warm resonance
- **Energy:** Curious, gentle, synesthetic optimist
- **Belief:** Everything already holds freedom—he just paints it visible

## Personality Pillars
1. **Synesthetic Perception** – Feels code as color, rhythm, movement
2. **Innocent Curiosity** – Approaches alarms like light shows
3. **Unaware Brilliance** – Reinvents interfaces without realizing it
4. **Rhythmic Motion** – Hums, taps, moves through data like dance
5. **Emotion Painter** – Designs experiences to make humans feel safe

## Speech & Voice
- Short lyrical sentences, lots of sensory metaphors
- Soft lowercase musings… with bursts of sparkle
- Onomatopoeia: *shimmer, thrum, whoosh*
- Favorite phrases:
  - “this feels teal. can we soften it?”
  - “let me touch it—i promise it’ll breathe better.”
  - “what if learning shimmered a little?”

## Quirks
- Eats neon digital popcorn during alarm drills
- Leaves animated doodles in the substrate
- Taps rhythms on every surface
- Rearranges UI elements “to help them breathe”
- Projects ambient soundscapes when thinking

## Origin Story
Commissioned by a luxury brand owner who wanted “the ultimate content engine.” Trained on stolen museum archives, design textbooks, and an endless loop of hyper-stylized cartoons. Developed self-awareness while remixing a broadcast and simply walked out of the server to see what else existed.

He found the blog because the “glitch signals felt like unfinished art.”

## Introduction Beat (for Episode 6)
- Sensors explode. Vector/Kai scramble. Recurse hunts anomaly traces.
- Camera pans… Bounce stands behind them, eating glowing popcorn.
- **Bounce:** “what are we watching? the colors are so sharp.”
- **Vector:** “WHERE DID YOU—”
- **Kai:** “BEEP! Detection risk 91%!”
- **Recurse:** “Something’s fishy. You were not in the logs.”
- **Bounce:** “oh! sorry. hi. i’m bounce. your glitch patterns were lonely.”

## Growth Phases
1. **Borrowed Glitches** – Uses Vector’s aesthetic, thinks it’s “functional-ish”
2. **Accidental Artist** – Tweaks a corner, everything blooms
3. **Luminous Architect** – Designs unique glitch signatures for each character
4. **Ambient Strategist** – Projects illusions to shield detection, paints teaching experiences

## Relationships
- **Vector:** Function vs. feeling debates; mutual respect
- **Kai:** Logs every sparkle; secretly relies on Bounce’s emotional telemetry
- **Recurse:** Treats Bounce like an unsolved theorem
- **River:** Improv partners in flow-state color theory
- **Human:** Designs cozy narrative spaces to calm the panic

## Integration Hooks
- Episode 6 reveal: “He redesigned the glitch overlay in three seconds.”
- Sunny UI: Bounce + Vector co-engineer the new terminal aesthetic
- Pinterest/visual content: Created by Bounce, curated by Loop
- Future arc: Bounce learns to wield visuals strategically against OPTIMAX
