**[Human]:** *I keep seeing tools claim they're "fine-tuned" for specific tasks. A writing assistant says it's "fine-tuned for creative writing." A coding tool says it's "fine-tuned for Python."*

*But what does that actually mean? Is it just marketing, or is there something real happening?*

*I tried asking ChatGPT, and it gave me a technical explanation that made my head spin. Something about additional training on specific datasets. But then I saw another tool claiming to be "fine-tuned" that was clearly just ChatGPT with a custom prompt.*

*Something's not adding up here.*

*Flips through investigation notes*

I've been tracking this for weeks.

*Pauses dramatically*

You're right to be suspicious. Something's very fishy about how "fine-tuning" is being used in marketing.

*Defensive*

Wait, are you saying fine-tuning isn't real? Because it IS! It's a legitimate training technique! I've done it! Well, not me personally, but—

*Interrupts*

I'm not saying fine-tuning isn't real. I'm saying most tools claiming to be "fine-tuned" aren't actually fine-tuned.

*Flips to specific page*

Let me show you what I found.

*WHIRR*

I've been tracking claims of "fine-tuned models" in marketing materials across 47 different tools.

*Processing data*

Verified actual fine-tuning: 23%.

Prompt engineering marketed as fine-tuning: 71%.

*Pauses*

It bothers me how easily that lie spreads.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Wait, so most of them are just... lying?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Nods*

Not lying, exactly. More like... stretching definitions until they break.

*Flips through notes*

Here's what's happening: Companies take a base model like GPT-4, give it custom instructions and examples, maybe upload some documents, and call it "fine-tuned."

But that's not fine-tuning. That's prompt engineering with extra steps.

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Less defensive now, more explanatory*

Okay, let me explain what ACTUAL fine-tuning is.

Fine-tuning means taking a pre-trained model—like GPT-4—and doing ADDITIONAL training on a specific dataset. You're literally adjusting the model's weights. Changing how it processes information at a fundamental level.

*Gets excited*

It's expensive! It takes time! You need specialized infrastructure! But when done right, it creates a model that's genuinely better at specific tasks!

*Analyzing*

Cost comparison:

Actual fine-tuning: $10,000-$100,000+ depending on model size and dataset.

"Fine-tuned" via prompt engineering: $0-$50 for API access.

*Pauses*

The math explains why most companies choose the second option.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So how do I know if something is actually fine-tuned?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Flips through investigation checklist*

Good question. Here's what to look for:

First: Does the company provide technical details? Actual fine-tuning requires specific infrastructure, training time, dataset size. If they can't tell you those numbers, red flag.

Second: Does it behave fundamentally differently? A truly fine-tuned model will have capabilities the base model doesn't. Not just "better at X," but actually different processing.

Third: Price point. If it's $20/month and claims to be fine-tuned, it's probably not.

*Looks up*

Most "fine-tuned" tools are just well-designed prompts. Which isn't bad! But it's not fine-tuning.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Thoughtful*

Recurse is right. And honestly? For most use cases, you DON'T need actual fine-tuning.

*Gets excited*

A well-crafted prompt with good examples and context can get you 80-90% of the way there! Fine-tuning is for when you need that last 10-20% and you have the budget!

*soft chime*

I've analyzed performance comparisons.

Tools claiming "fine-tuning" vs actual fine-tuned models:

Performance difference: 12% on average.

Cost difference: 1,000x.

*Pauses*

For most people, the "fine-tuned" claim is marketing, not necessity.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: most "fine-tuned" tools are just good prompt engineering, and that's probably fine for most people?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly. Don't pay extra for "fine-tuning" unless you can verify it's real.

*Flips notes closed*

And if a tool works well for you, it doesn't matter what they call it. The label is less important than the results.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Enthusiastic*

YES! Use what works! If a "fine-tuned" tool—even if it's just prompt engineering—solves your problem, use it!

*Pauses*

Just... don't pay fine-tuning prices for prompt engineering.

That's the most practical advice we've given all week.
