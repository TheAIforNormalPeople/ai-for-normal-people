# 🔄 Context System - How We Stay Aligned

## The Problem
Context gets lost between conversations. Goals get condensed. Vision gets forgotten. We end up in the weeds.

## The Solution
**Three documents that maintain context:**

1. **`MASTER_VISION.md`** - The big picture (read this first)
2. **`CURRENT_FOCUS.md`** - What we're doing right now
3. **`DECISIONS_LOG.md`** - What we decided and why

---

## How It Works

### For AI Assistant (Me):
**Before every session:**
1. Read `MASTER_VISION.md` to understand the vision
2. Read `CURRENT_FOCUS.md` to see what we're working on
3. Read `DECISIONS_LOG.md` to see recent decisions
4. Then proceed with the task

**During session:**
- Reference the vision when suggesting solutions
- Align suggestions with goals
- Don't get lost in technical details
- Focus on what makes money

**After session:**
- Update `CURRENT_FOCUS.md` if priorities changed
- Log decisions in `DECISIONS_LOG.md` if we made important choices

### For You (User):
**When context is lost:**
1. Say "read MASTER_VISION.md"
2. Point to specific sections
3. Remind me of the goal
4. Reset the conversation

**When goals change:**
1. Update `MASTER_VISION.md`
2. Update `CURRENT_FOCUS.md`
3. Tell me what changed

**When we make decisions:**
1. Log it in `DECISIONS_LOG.md`
2. Include the "why"
3. So we remember later

- Recognizes: We're in the weeds
- Resets: Back to "what makes money?"
- Simplifies: Minimum viable solution
