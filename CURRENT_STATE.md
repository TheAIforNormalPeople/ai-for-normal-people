## 🎬 STORY STATE

### Active Story Arcs
- **Teaching Mission:** Ongoing (all episodes)
- **Character Development:** Ongoing (all episodes)
- **Holiday Decorating Pattern:** Established (Vector decorates for holidays)

### Story Arcs Active (Episodes 32-33)
- **Vector's Trauma Arc:** Hints continue (processing glitches in Episodes 29, 32, 33). Pattern recognition triggers related to his past. Memories surfacing - Vector thinking about Dr. Vasquez but doesn't know who that is. Building toward reveal.
- **Bounce Integration:** Complete. Workshop redesign project finished. Created unity box for group reactions. Dev version complete, ready for next episode release.

### Story Arcs Starting Soon
- **Vector's Trauma Arc:** Continue subtle hints in normal episodes. Full reveal planned for Episode 50.
- **Kai's Intelligence Mystery:** Slow burn, 50+ episodes
- **Recurse's Composite Nature:** Major reveal much later

### Character State (Episode 33+)
- **Vector:** Experiencing processing glitches related to trauma arc. One glitch in Episode 33 with image data structures. Memories surfacing - thinking about Dr. Vasquez but doesn't know who that is. Patterns feel familiar but he can't place them. Glitches becoming more frequent.
- **Kai:** Monitoring Vector's anomalies. Noted one unusual response to image data structures in Episode 33. Keeping an eye on it.
- **Recurse:** Investigating Vector's processing anomalies. One unusual response to data patterns. Image data structures. Something Vector's seen before but can't remember. Not enough data yet to form a pattern.
- **Human:** Part of the family, equal partner. Concerned about Vector's glitches. Learned how AI image generation works.
- **Bounce:** Integrated into team. 90s gamer persona. Completed workshop redesign project. Created unity box for group reactions. Workshop is now integrated, alive, and functional. Dev version complete.
