## WHY THIS WORKS FOR SEO

1. **More Content = More Opportunities**
   - 50 posts = 50 chances to rank for different keywords
   - More pages for Google to index
   - More internal linking opportunities

2. **Daily Publishing Signals**
   - Shows Google you're active
   - Fresh content signals
   - Better crawl frequency

3. **Volume Before Quality**
   - Get to 50 quickly
   - Then focus on quality/optimization
   - Can always improve old posts later

4. **Momentum**
   - Daily publishing builds habit
   - Keeps you in production mode
   - Easier to maintain once you have volume

## AUTO-PUBLISH SYSTEM

✅ **GitHub Action runs daily at 9:00 AM UTC**
- Checks for posts with `draft: true`
- If `date` matches today → changes to `draft: false`
- Commits and pushes (triggers Netlify build)

✅ **All episodes 6-25 are ready**
- Dates updated to daily schedule
- All marked `draft: true`
- Will auto-publish on their scheduled dates

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (You're Ready!)
- ✅ Episodes 6-25 will auto-publish daily starting tomorrow
- ✅ No action needed - GitHub Action handles it

### Next 20 Days
- Monitor auto-publishing (should happen automatically)
- Track which posts are ranking
- Note which topics/keywords perform best

### Days 21-45 (Create Episodes 26-50)
- Generate 25 more episodes using the same system
- Follow the character evolution guidelines
- Use the quality control system
- Publish daily as you create them
