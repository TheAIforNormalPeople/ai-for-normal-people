## Usage

1. **After revising each episode:** Mark if gag appears
2. **Check frequency:** Ensure not too much, not too little
3. **Track evolution:** Gags should evolve, not just repeat
4. **Plan payoffs:** Major gag moments (Ep 20, 24, 28, 48)

---

## Notes

- Gags should feel organic, not forced
- Evolution shows character growth
- Major moments need setup (don't come out of nowhere)
- Some gags resolve (Doctor Vector), others evolve (Three Questions)
