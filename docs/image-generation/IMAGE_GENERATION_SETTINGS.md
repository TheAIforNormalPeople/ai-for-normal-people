# IMAGE GENERATION SETTINGS
## Quick Answers for Vector Generation

**Created:** 2025-12-29  
**Purpose:** Quick reference for image generator settings

## RECOMMENDED SETTINGS

### 1. Setting: **Full-body character sheet on a plain background**
**Why:**
- See the complete design (hat, hair, body, proportions)
- Plain background keeps focus on character
- Best for evaluating the full design
- Can see how everything works together

**Alternative if you want to focus on details:**
- Portrait only (head + hat + wires) - Good for seeing hat/face details first

---

### 2. Style Variant: **Slight texture / retro grain** OR **High-contrast bold outlines**
**Why:**
- **Slight texture/retro grain:** Adds character, not too clean, fits "escaped experiment" feel
- **High-contrast bold outlines:** Very Adventure Time, clear and defined
- Both work well - choose based on preference

**Avoid:**
- Clean vector illustration (might be too clean, not enough character)
- Soft pastel (might be too soft, not enough presence)

---

### 3. Animal Hat Choice: **Weasel** (recommended first) OR **Tasmanian Devil**
**Why:**
- **Weasel:** Smart/sneaky - fits "intelligent rebel" who escaped, fits "hacker/thinker" personality
- **Tasmanian Devil:** Wild/crazy - fits "loony/crazy" energy perfectly, very distinctive

**Recommendation:** Start with **Weasel** (fits intelligent rebel better), then try **Tasmanian Devil** if you want more wild/crazy energy
