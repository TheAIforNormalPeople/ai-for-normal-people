## Template Structure

```
REVISE EPISODE [X]: [TITLE]

EPISODE TYPE: [Standard/Character/Crisis/Experimental]
INTENSITY: [Calm/Moderate/High Energy]
EVOLUTION STAGE: [early/mid/later]

EDUCATIONAL GOAL:
[Topic to teach]

CHARACTER BEAT (if Character type):
- Who: [Vector/Kai/Recurse/Human]
- What changes: [before → after]
- Why it matters: [emotional/story reason]

STORY THREADS:
- Caused by: Episode [X-1] when [event]
- Will cause: Episode [X+1] where [consequence]

RUNNING GAGS:
- [Gag name]: [how it appears/evolves]

STRUCTURE:
1. Opening: [setup]
2. Complication: [character moment]
3. Education: [teach through conflict]
4. Resolution: [growth + lesson]

CHARACTER VOICE REQUIREMENTS:
- Vector: [catchphrase usage, speech patterns]
- Kai: [evolved sounds, detection warnings]
- Recurse: [three questions, skeptical tone]
- Human: [narration style, growth moment]

SEO REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: [SEO-optimized]
- Keywords: [list]
- Description: [brief]
- Length: 1200-1800 words

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
- ✅ Educational value
- ✅ Character voices distinct
- ✅ Cause-and-effect from previous

- ✅ Intensity appropriate
- ✅ Running gags (not spam)
- ✅ Would someone want to read this?

## Example: Episode 12

```
REVISE EPISODE 12: "How Neural Networks Actually Learn"

EPISODE TYPE: Standard
INTENSITY: Moderate
EVOLUTION STAGE: mid

EDUCATIONAL GOAL:
Explain how neural networks learn from data (backpropagation, gradient descent, training process)

CHARACTER BEAT:
- Vector's over-technical explanation flops
- Realizes accuracy ≠ helpful

STORY THREADS:
- Caused by: Episode 11 (characters were polite, now ramping up)
- Will cause: Episode 13 (Human gives feedback)

RUNNING GAGS:
- Doctor Vector: First correction ("It's DOCTOR Vector!")
- Kai's warnings: More specific detection warnings
- Recurse's three questions: Questions about learning process

STRUCTURE:
1. Opening: Human starts explaining poorly, Vector interrupts
2. Complication: Vector's explanation too technical, loses readers
3. Education: Teach through Vector's correction + simplification
4. Resolution: Vector realizes he needs to adjust approach

CHARACTER VOICE REQUIREMENTS:
- Vector: "FASCINATING!" 1-2x max, ALL CAPS for emphasis, self-interrupts
- Kai: *WHIRR-CLICK* for processing, evolved sounds (not just BEEP)
- Recurse: Exactly three questions about learning process
- Human: *Sighs* watching Vector spiral, asks for simpler explanation

SEO REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: "How Neural Networks Actually Learn (Explained for Normal People)"
- Keywords: neural networks, machine learning, how AI learns, training data
- Description: "Vector explains how neural networks learn from data. Learn about backpropagation, gradient descent, and why training takes so long."
- Length: 1500 words

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
- ✅ Educational value (explains learning process clearly)
- ✅ Character voices distinct (Vector enthusiastic, Kai monitoring, Recurse questioning)
- ✅ Cause-and-effect (ramps up from polite Ep 1-11)
- ✅ Sets up next episode (Human feedback in Ep 13)
- ✅ Intensity appropriate (Moderate - not chaos, not calm)
- ✅ Running gags (Doctor Vector introduced, Kai sounds, Recurse questions)
- ✅ Would someone want to read this? (Yes - educational + entertaining)

## Batch Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Batch
- Episodes 12-15: Proof of concept
- Episodes 16-20: Rhythm establishment
- Episodes 21-30: Character development
- Episodes 31-40: Story-first approach
- Episodes 41-50: Resolution arc

### Step 2: Fill Template for Each Episode
- Use episode roadmap from THE_NORMAL_PEOPLE_COMPLETE.md
- Check story thread tracker for cause-and-effect
- Check running gag tracker for gag usage
- Verify character evolution stage

### Step 3: Revise Using Template
- Use Cursor with master context
- Apply template requirements
- Maintain educational core
- Add character personality

### Step 4: Validate
- Run character voice checker
- Verify story threads connected
- Check running gag frequency
- Quality checklist pass

### Step 5: Review & Refine
- Test on Episode 12 first
- Adjust template based on results
- Scale to batch

## Tips

1. **Start with Episode 12** - Test the approach before batching
2. **Use templates consistently** - Ensures quality across batches
3. **Track as you go** - Update thread/gag trackers after each revision
4. **Validate before moving on** - Fix issues before next episode
5. **Adjust template** - Refine based on what works
