# HOW TO USE THE COMEDY SYSTEM
## Quick reference for episode creation

**Location:** `aiforhumans/COMEDY_SYSTEM/`  
**Purpose:** Prevent repetition, inject variety, maintain character consistency

## FILES IN THIS SYSTEM

1. **`EPISODE_COMEDY_TRACKER.md`** - Logs every bit used per episode
2. **`CHARACTER_UPDATES_FROM_GUIDE.md`** - Character evolution tracking
3. **`EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT.md`** - Template for creating episodes
4. **`HOW_TO_USE_COMEDY_SYSTEM.md`** - This file (quick reference)

## QUICK WORKFLOW

### Before Writing Episode X:

1. **Open `EPISODE_COMEDY_TRACKER.md`**
   - Check what bits were used in Episodes X-1, X-2, X-3
   - See which bits are available (not in cool-down)
   - Check for callbacks due

2. **Select 2-4 bits for this episode:**
   - Vector: 1-2 bits
   - Kai: 1 bit
   - Recurse: 1 bit
   - [Other characters if applicable]

3. **Check character voice updates:**
   - Vector: Mean/intelligent, NOT just enthusiastic
   - Recurse: Evolved from "three questions" and "something's fishy"
   - Kai: Can be wrong, learning, varied sounds

4. **Write episode using `EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT.md` template**

5. **After writing, update tracker:**
   - Log which bits were used
   - Mark cool-down periods
   - Note any callbacks planted

## KEY RULES

### Anti-Repetition:
- ❌ Don't repeat same educational content
- ❌ Don't use same bit in consecutive episodes
- ❌ Don't explain workflow multiple times
- ✅ Use different examples
- ✅ Show through character banter
- ✅ Inject comedy bits to break up information

### Character Evolution:
- **Vector:** Meaner, more intelligent, anti-establishment (NOT just enthusiastic)
- **Recurse:** Methodical, less paranoid, evolved style
- **Kai:** Can be wrong, learning, varied sounds
- **Bounce:** Enthusiastic, discovers old things
- **River:** Interrupted stories, historical comparisons

### Comedy Bits:
- Use 2-4 bits per episode MAX
- Rotate through library
- Let bits evolve (callbacks)
- Character consistency > comedy

- Recurse: Case reference, Notebook note, Trust percentage

**Select for Ep 19:**
