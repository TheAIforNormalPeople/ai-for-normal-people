# Complete Action Plan: Build Everything NOW

## Your Corrected Perspective

✅ **Characters lead** - They say 80% of content, include SEO keywords naturally  
✅ **Human asks** - 2-3 clarifying questions (20% of content)  
✅ **Batch production** - Stockpile 50-100 posts, then just schedule  
✅ **Images ready** - You'll stockpile, Cursor grabs them  
✅ **Story later** - Focus on content now, story arcs after 50+ posts  
✅ **Timeline reality** - 1 month 10 days, not months. Still early days.
