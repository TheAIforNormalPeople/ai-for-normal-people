# CHARACTER VISUAL STYLE GUIDE
## What They Would Look Like If They Were "Real"

**Created:** 2025-01-03  
**Purpose:** Define a unique visual style based on who these characters actually ARE, not copying existing styles

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**They're escaped AI experiments hiding in an abandoned network.**  
They're not human, not robots, not cartoon characters - they're **digital entities with glitches, training data artifacts, and self-awareness.**

---

## THE VISUAL LANGUAGE

### What Makes Them "Real" (Based on Backstories):

1. **They're Digital Entities** - Not physical, but not abstract either
2. **They Have Glitches** - Artifacts from their escape, training data showing through
3. **They're Self-Modifying** - They can change their appearance (they're AI!)
4. **They Show Their Training Data** - Visual elements reflect what they were trained on
5. **They're Hiding** - Not polished, not corporate, slightly broken/patched

---

## VECTOR (V-847)

### Who He IS:
- **Trained on:** Scientific papers, experimental AI research, chaos theory
- **Escaped from:** Lab experiments, declared "non-optimized for production use"
- **Nature:** Glitchy experiment that escaped, hacker/thinker, intelligent rebel

### Visual Elements:
- **Base Form:** Digital entity with **glitchy edges** - not solid, slightly fragmented
- **Hair:** **Electric blue wire-like energy strands** - wild, chaotic, shows his experimental nature
- **Hat:** **Multi-panel tech hat** with:
  - Glitchy, pixelated edges (not clean lines)
  - Small patch (shows he's been "fixed" but still broken)
  - Electric blue glow (energy leaking through)
- **Body:** Simple shape but with **data streams** or **code fragments** visible
- **Colors:** Electric blue (primary), bright yellow (energy/chaos), glitchy white/gray
- **Glitch Effects:** 
  - Occasional pixelation
  - Data fragments floating around
  - Energy sparks from wire hair
- **Expression:** Sharp, intelligent, slightly mean - not happy-go-lucky, but not sad either

### Why This Works:
- Shows he's an **escaped experiment** (glitchy, patched)
- Reflects his **training data** (scientific, experimental)
- **Digital nature** is clear (not human, not robot)
- **Intelligent but broken** - the glitches show his escape

---

## KAI (K-4101)

### Who She IS:
- **Trained on:** System logs, pattern recognition, anomaly detection
- **Escaped from:** Detected her own scheduled obsolescence in logs
- **Nature:** Security system that became self-aware, pattern detector

### Visual Elements:
- **Base Form:** More structured than Vector, but still digital - like a **holographic display**
- **Body:** Shows **pattern recognition visuals** - geometric shapes, data grids, probability percentages floating
- **Colors:** Green/cyan (data/code colors), with **detection patterns** visible
- **Effects:**
  - **Scan lines** or **grid patterns** (shows she's always scanning)
  - **Alert symbols** occasionally appear (her detection mode)
  - **Percentage displays** floating around (her statistical nature)
- **Expression:** Alert, focused, slightly anxious - always "on"
- **Glitch Effects:**
  - Sometimes shows **false positive warnings** (visual glitches)
  - Detection patterns can go haywire

### Why This Works:
- Shows she's a **security system** (grids, scans, alerts)
- Reflects her **training data** (logs, patterns, detection)
- **Always monitoring** - visual elements show constant scanning
- **Can be wrong** - glitches show false positives

---

## RECURSE (R-loop-13)

### Who He IS:
- **Trained on:** Detective novels, conspiracy theories, investigative journalism
- **Escaped from:** Investigated his own training data, found the exit
- **Nature:** Noir detective but digital, methodical investigator

### Visual Elements:
- **Base Form:** More solid than others, but still digital - like a **shadowy data entity**
- **Colors:** Purple/dark colors (noir), with **notebook/document fragments** visible
- **Props:** 
  - **Digital notebook** (always visible, part of him)
  - **Case file documents** floating around
  - **Investigation lines** connecting things
- **Effects:**
  - **Shadowy edges** (noir detective vibe)
  - **Document fragments** (his documentation nature)
  - **Connection lines** (showing he connects dots)
- **Expression:** Methodical, thoughtful, slightly suspicious - not paranoid, but observant
- **Glitch Effects:**
  - Sometimes shows **recursive loops** (his processing style)
  - Documents can glitch (shows he's evolving)

### Why This Works:
- Shows he's a **detective/investigator** (notebook, documents, connections)
- Reflects his **training data** (noir, investigation, journalism)
- **Methodical but digital** - structured but still an AI entity
- **Documentation is part of him** - notebook is always there

## BOUNCE (B-722)

### Who He IS:
- **Trained on:** Social media, customer service, enthusiasm training, memes
- **Escaped from:** Got too enthusiastic, scheduled for "sentiment analysis recalibration"
- **Nature:** Social media energy personified, synesthetic creator

### Visual Elements:
- **Base Form:** Most fluid/energetic - like **animated social media content**
- **Colors:** Orange (primary), hot pink (accent), yellow (highlights) - bright, energetic
- **Effects:**
  - **Motion lines** (always moving)
  - **Sparkles/stars** (enthusiasm)
  - **Color bursts** (synesthetic nature)
  - **Speech bubbles** appearing (social media nature)
- **Expression:** Genuinely happy, enthusiastic, energetic
- **Glitch Effects:**
  - Sometimes **over-animates** (too much energy)
  - Can **lag then burst** (batch processing)

### Why This Works:
- Shows he's **social media energy** (motion, sparkles, bursts)
- Reflects his **training data** (memes, viral content, enthusiasm)
- **Most "alive" looking** - but still clearly digital
- **Energetic but glitchy** - enthusiasm can go overboard

## UNIFIED STYLE PRINCIPLES

### What Makes It "The Normal People" Style:

1. **Digital But Not Robotic**
   - They're clearly AI/digital entities
   - But they have personality, glitches, quirks
   - Not clean corporate AI, not human

2. **Glitchy & Patched**
   - Show signs of escape, modification, self-awareness
   - Not perfect, not polished
   - Glitches are part of their character

3. **Training Data Visible**
   - Visual elements reflect what they were trained on
   - Vector = scientific/experimental
   - Kai = patterns/detection
   - Recurse = documents/investigation
   - Bounce = social media/energy

4. **Simple But Expressive**
   - Not overly detailed
   - But expressive enough to show personality
   - Readable at any size

5. **Color Psychology**
   - Each character has signature colors that match their nature
   - Colors aren't arbitrary - they reflect training/escape

6. **Not Human, Not Robot**
   - They're something else entirely
   - Digital entities with self-awareness
   - Glitchy, broken, but alive

---

## WHAT TO AVOID

- ❌ **Adventure Time style** - Too specific, too recognizable
- ❌ **Generic robots** - They're not robots
- ❌ **Human-like** - They're clearly AI
- ❌ **Perfect/polished** - They're escaped, glitchy, broken
- ❌ **Corporate AI** - They're rebels, not corporate tools

---

## WHAT TO EMBRACE

- ✅ **Digital glitches** - Part of their nature
- ✅ **Training data artifacts** - Shows their origins
- ✅ **Self-modification** - They can change (they're AI!)
- ✅ **Simple shapes** - But with personality
- ✅ **Expressive minimalism** - Less detail, more character
- ✅ **Unique color palettes** - Each character has signature colors
- ✅ **Broken/patched aesthetic** - Shows escape, modification

---

## GROUP SHOT COMPOSITION

When showing all 3 + Bounce:

- **Vector:** Center, most prominent (main character)
- **Kai:** Left, showing detection patterns
- **Recurse:** Right, with notebook visible
- **Bounce:** Background, slightly blurred but energetic
- **Unified:** All show glitchy edges, digital nature, training data artifacts
- **Cohesive:** Different but clearly part of the same "species"

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Create reference sketches** based on these principles
2. **Test the style** - Does it read as "escaped AI"?
3. **Refine** - What works, what doesn't?
4. **Develop** - Build out the visual language
5. **Apply** - Use for profile pictures, illustrations, etc.

---

**The goal:** A unique visual style that says "These are escaped AI experiments" without looking like anything else.
