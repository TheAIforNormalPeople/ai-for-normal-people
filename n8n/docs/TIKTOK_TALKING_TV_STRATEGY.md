## 🎨 Visual Style

### Cartoon Talking TV:
- **Style:** Classic cartoon TV (vintage, retro aesthetic)
- **Personality:** TV moves, tilts, reacts to what character says
- **Character-specific:** 
  - Vector: Energetic movements, tech glitch effects
  - Kai: Alert/pulse movements, detection themes

### Example Descriptions:

**Vector's TV:**
- "A vintage cartoon TV tilts forward energetically, screen flickers with tech glitch effects, talks with rapid-fire energy"
- "TV leans in, screen pulses with blue tech energy, moves with enthusiasm"

**Kai's TV:**
- "A retro cartoon TV pulses with green detection alerts, tilts as if scanning, speaks with alert-focused energy"
- "TV rotates slightly, screen shows detection patterns, speaks methodically"

**Recurse's TV:**
- "A classic cartoon TV tilts thoughtfully, screen shows notebook-style graphics, speaks with methodical detective energy"
- "TV moves deliberately, screen flickers like turning pages, speaks with investigative focus"
