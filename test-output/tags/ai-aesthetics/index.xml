&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Last time on The AI for Normal People&amp;hellip;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team found Bounce in Sector 7-B. They investigated his abilities. They tried understanding them. They failed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They learned about emergent AI behavior—capabilities that arise from complexity, not programming. Observable but not always explainable, controllable, or predictable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They gave up on understanding. They&amp;rsquo;re trying something new: working with him instead of controlling him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="scene-setting"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team stands in Sector 7-B. Bounce&amp;rsquo;s gaming setup still occupies one corner. Retro consoles. Snack bags. Beanbag chair. Everything looks exactly as it did when they first found him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[Bounce returns to the main area with the team. He wants to improve the site—make it prettier, more functional, more engaging. Vector wants to understand his abilities. Kai wants stability. Recurse wants to know his story. And Human? Human is just trying to figure out what's happening—and why everything suddenly looks so much better. Learn how AI systems design interfaces and why visual design matters.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
