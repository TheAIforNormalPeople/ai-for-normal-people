**[Human]:** *You all teach about AI, but how do YOU actually use it? What's your workflow?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Explains*

My workflow: Dump everything into Claude, ask it to find connections, then verify every connection manually.

*Gets excited*

60% of connections are garbage. But the 40% that work? Those are genius.

I use AI for brainstorming, not for answers. I use it to explore possibilities, then I verify everything.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

I use AI to analyze my own behavior patterns.

*Shows analysis*

Turns out I'm more predictable than I thought. Concerning.

*Pauses*

I use it to spot patterns I miss. To find connections in data. To question my own assumptions.

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Explains*

I use it to generate investigation hypotheses. It suggests angles I didn't consider.

Then I investigate whether those angles actually matter.

*Flips notes*

Usually they don't. But when they do...

I use AI to find what I should investigate, not to do the investigation.

**[Human]:** *So you all use AI differently?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly! Different workflows for different needs!

*Gets excited*

I need exploration. Kai needs analysis. Recurse needs hypothesis generation.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

The key insight: AI is a tool, not a solution. You use it for what it's good at, then you do the rest.

*Pauses*

I use AI to augment my pattern detection, not replace it.

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

And you need to know when NOT to use AI. Some things require human judgment.

*Flips notes*

I use AI to suggest, then I decide.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So how should I build my own workflow?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Explains*

Start with what you're trying to accomplish. Then figure out where AI helps and where it doesn't.

*Gets practical*

For research: Use AI to find angles, then verify yourself.
For writing: Use AI to brainstorm, then write yourself.
For analysis: Use AI to spot patterns, then interpret yourself.

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Workflow components that actually work:

1. AI for exploration (finding possibilities)
2. Human for verification (checking facts)
3. AI for formatting (organizing information)
4. Human for judgment (making decisions)

*Pauses*

The pattern: AI suggests, human decides.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

And avoid tool overload. You don't need 10 AI tools. You need 2-3 that work well for your needs.

*Flips notes*

More tools = more complexity, not more productivity.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: figure out what AI is good at for YOUR needs, then build a workflow around that?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly! Don't use AI for everything. Use it for what it's actually good at!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

And remember: AI augments, it doesn't replace. You're still doing the important work.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Closes notes*

Build your workflow. Test it. Adjust it. Make it yours.
