## Key Rules

1. **Catchphrases are rare and meaningful** - not constant noise
2. **Personality shows through word choice** - not just catchphrases
3. **Characters are learning** - they should evolve over time
4. **80% normal speech, 20% characteristic moments** - not the other way around

## Evolution Timeline

- **Episodes 1-10:** More catchphrases, less self-aware
- **Episodes 11-25:** Self-aware, start catching themselves
- **Episodes 26-50:** Mature, catchphrases rare and meaningful
