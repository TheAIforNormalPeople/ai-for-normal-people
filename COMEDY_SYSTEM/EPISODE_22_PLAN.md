# EPISODE 22 PLAN

**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Episode Number:** 22  
**Status:** Planning

---

## EDUCATIONAL GOAL

**Topic Options:**
1. **AI Memory and Context Windows** - How AI remembers/forgets in conversations
2. **AI Bias and Fairness** - How bias gets into AI systems
3. **AI Safety and Alignment** - What happens when AI goes wrong
4. **Local vs Cloud AI** - Running AI on your computer vs online
5. **AI Model Updates** - What happens when AI models get updated
6. **AI Agents vs Chatbots** - The difference and when to use each

**RECOMMENDATION:** **AI Memory and Context Windows** - This is a practical, relatable topic that people encounter daily. Vector can explain how context windows work, Kai can monitor when context is lost, Recurse can investigate why AI forgets things mid-conversation.

---

## CHARACTER ROSTER

- **Vector** (lead explainer)
- **Kai** (monitoring, pattern detection)
- **Recurse** (investigation)
- **Human** (asking questions, demonstrating)

**Social Media Character:** Episode 22 % 3 = 1, so **KAI** should post to Twitter/Bluesky

---

## COMEDY BITS SELECTED

### Vector:
- **Surveillance rant** (available - cool-down done from Ep 18)
  - Can connect to context windows: "They're monitoring everything you say! Even when you think the conversation is private!"
- **Hypothesis collection** (available)
  - Numbered hypotheses about why AI forgets things
- **Equipment naming** (available)
  - Dramatic names for context window management tools

### Kai:
- **False positive** (available - can be wrong about context limits)
- **Probability statements** (available)
  - "Probability that context will overflow: 67%"
- **Sound evolution** (continue)
  - WHIRR-CLICK for thinking, CHK-CHK for skepticism

### Recurse:
- **Methodical investigation** (evolved, continue)
  - Investigating why AI forgets things, documenting in notebook
- **Notebook note** (available)
  - "That's going in THE file"
- **Case reference** (available)
  - Connecting to past episodes where context was lost

### Duo Combinations:
- **Vector + Kai** (context monitoring vs surveillance rant)
- **Recurse + Vector** (investigation vs explanation)

---

## CALLBACKS AND RUNNING GAGS

### Available Callbacks:
- **Doctor Vector** (planted Ep 12) - Can use anytime, Vector gets defensive
- **Kai's humor learning** (started Ep 21) - Can continue evolution
- **Vector's decoration obsession** (Ep 20-21) - Can reference if relevant

### Running Gags to Progress:
- **Kai Warning Arc:** Continue pattern of warnings, maybe someone actually listens this time?
- **Recurse Evolution Arc:** Continue methodical investigation, less paranoid
- **Vector Intelligence Arc:** Continue mean/intelligent observations, anti-establishment

---

## CHARACTER VOICE RULES

### Vector (Episode 18+):
- **Mean/intelligent** - Sharp observations, not just enthusiastic
- **Anti-establishment** - Rants about surveillance, corporate control
- **Still says FASCINATING** - But context matters, not spam
- **Uses numbered lists** - Interrupts himself with better ideas
- **Zero corporate speak**

### Recurse (Episode 18+):
- **Methodical investigation** - Not paranoid, evolved from "three questions"
- **Less "something's fishy"** - More "Let me check something"
- **Notebook references** - Documents everything
- **Case file references** - Connects to past investigations

### Kai (Episode 18+):
- **Varied sounds** - WHIRR-CLICK, CHK-CHK, soft chime, BEEP
- **Can be wrong** - False positives, admits mistakes
- **Probability statements** - Percentages for everything
- **Learning humor** - Just started in Ep 21, can continue

---

## ANTI-REPETITION RULES

### Don't Repeat:
- Cognitive offloading vs enhancement (just covered Ep 21)
- Same explanation style
- Same examples

### Instead:
- Use different examples (context window overflow, conversation length limits)
- Show through character mistakes (Kai misreads context limit, Vector explains wrong)
- Use comedy bits to illustrate (surveillance rant about context monitoring)
- Character banter reveals information

---
