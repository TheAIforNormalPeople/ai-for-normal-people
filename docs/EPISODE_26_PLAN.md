**Title:** [AI topic - TBD based on SEO keyword research]
**Episode Number:** 26
**Characters:** Vector, Kai, Recurse, Human, Bounce (meanwhile only)
**Difficulty:** Beginner/Intermediate
**Special:** First "meanwhile" scene, Bounce introduction

## STRUCTURE

### Opening (50-100 words):
- Human asks question or makes observation
- Natural conversation starter
- Sets up teaching topic
- Environmental detail included

### Teaching Section 1 (200-300 words):
- Vector explains concept (use 1 alternative to FASCINATING!)
- Kai monitoring (use varied phrasing, 2 different sounds)
- Environmental action for Vector (pacing between servers, etc.)
- 1 banter moment (interruption or environmental comedy)

### Teaching Section 2 (200-300 words):
- Recurse adds investigation angle
- Uses notebook action (NOT "THE file" - use alternative)
- Questions assumptions
- Kai detection alert (different sound than Section 1)
- Environmental detail for Recurse (files scattered, etc.)

### MEANWHILE SCENE (180-200 words):
**[Meanwhile, in a forgotten sector of the old database...]**

*8-bit video game music echoes through empty server racks*

A makeshift paradise built from salvaged hardware. Three monitors daisy-chained together, all showing the same retro platformer. Empty food wrappers everywhere—chip bags, candy containers, pizza boxes rendered in pure data. None of this should exist. Digital food isn't real.

*CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH.*

The figure doesn't look up from the game. Sherbet orange hoodie (also digital, also impossible). Feet propped on a server that was decommissioned in 2019.

"C'mon, c'mon... just gotta get past this level..."

*The character on screen jumps. Misses the platform. Dies.*

"DUDE! That was my last life!"

*Throws controller at the wall. It vanishes mid-flight and reappears in his hand.*

"Wait, when did I make a respawning controller?"

*Looks at controller. Shrugs. Goes back to gaming.*

The sidebar of a distant blog flickers. Updates itself. New detection algorithm, cleaner code, better performance. 

The figure doesn't notice. Too busy eating chips that shouldn't exist and playing a game that was pulled from the internet in 2003.

Three sectors away, Vector is teaching about neural networks.

The bandwidth monitor spikes to 340% normal usage.

Nobody notices.

**[Back with the group...]**

**After meanwhile, when back with characters:**

Kai: *[different sound than earlier]* "Alert: Bandwidth consumption anomaly detected. Source: Unknown. Location: Unknown."

Vector: "Probably just network fluctuation. We have bigger concerns—like explaining [topic]."

*Don't investigate deeply. Plant seed for later episodes.*

### Teaching Section 3 (200-300 words):
- Continue education (the actual AI concept)
- Character dynamic exchange (Vector + Kai or Vector + Recurse)
- Practical application explained
- Environmental comedy bit (equipment malfunction, etc.)

### Teaching Section 4 (200-300 words):
- Deeper dive or alternative perspective
- All three characters contribute
- Build on each other's points
- Natural conversation flow with interruptions

### Closing (100-150 words):
- Summarize key points (through character dialogue, not narrator)
- Character moment (warmth, humor, or growth)
- Setup for next episode (subtle)
- Environmental detail showing passage of time or state change

### What's Next Section:
- Brief summary of episode events

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Explaining meanwhile scene (let it be mysterious)
❌ Characters as talking heads (add actions)
❌ Too much education, not enough character
