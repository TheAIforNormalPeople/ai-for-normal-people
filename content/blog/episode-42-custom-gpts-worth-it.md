**[Human]:** *Everyone's making Custom GPTs now. Are they actually custom, or just saved prompts?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating*

I've been testing this. Let me show you what I found.

*Presents findings*

I tested 50 "custom GPTs." Here's what I discovered:

47 are just prompt templates with uploaded docs.
2 have actual custom data that matters.
1 is... just ChatGPT with a different name.

*Flips through notes*

"Custom" is doing a LOT of marketing work here.

**[Human]:** *So most aren't actually custom?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Explains*

Technically, Custom GPTs ARE custom. They have custom instructions, custom knowledge bases, custom capabilities.

*Gets thoughtful*

But they're not custom MODELS. They're the same GPT-4 with custom settings.

*Analyzing*

What's actually custom:
- System prompt (instructions)
- Knowledge base (uploaded files)
- Capabilities (which tools it can use)

What's NOT custom:
- The underlying model (still GPT-4)
- The architecture
- The training

*Pauses*

So "custom" means "configured differently," not "built differently."

*Investigating further*

You could replicate 94% of these by copying the prompt and uploading the same files.

*Flips notes*

Something's very fishy about calling this "custom."

**[Human]:** *So I can just save my prompts?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Practical*

Yes! That's basically what Custom GPTs are! Saved prompts with a nice UI!

*Gets excited*

But the UI is helpful! It makes it easier to manage! And the knowledge base integration is useful!

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Value assessment:

- If you use the same prompt frequently: Custom GPT saves time
- If you need knowledge base integration: Custom GPT is useful
- If you just want to try different prompts: Regular ChatGPT is fine

*Pauses*

It's convenience, not revolutionary functionality.

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

And be skeptical of "custom GPTs" being sold. Most are just prompts you could write yourself.

*Closes notes*

Don't pay for what you can do for free.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: Custom GPTs are useful for convenience, but not actually custom models?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly! They're custom configurations, not custom models!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

Use them if they save you time. Don't expect magic.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Nods*

And always verify claims. "Custom" means different things to different people.
