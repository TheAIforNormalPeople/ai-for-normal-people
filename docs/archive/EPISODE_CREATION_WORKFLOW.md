# EPISODE CREATION WORKFLOW

## MANDATORY: SEO Keyword Integration at Grand Scale

**CRITICAL RULE:** Every new episode MUST go through comprehensive SEO keyword integration. This is not optional. This is how we ensure discoverability.

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-WRITING (SEO-First Planning)

### Step 1: Topic Selection & Keyword Research
**Before writing a single word:**

1. **Identify Core Topic** (e.g., "AI hallucination", "fine-tuning", "RLHF")
2. **Consult `SEO_AI_KEYWORDS_STRATEGY.md`** for relevant high-value terms
3. **Map Keywords to Character Voices:**
   - Vector → Explains concepts (LLM, neural network, transformer architecture)
   - Kai → Monitors with stats (training data, context window, token limits)
   - Recurse → Investigates patterns (training dataset, contamination, patterns)
   - Human → Natural reflection (AI chatbot, ChatGPT, AI tools)

4. **Create Keyword Integration Plan:**
   - List 8-12 high-value terms for this episode
   - Note which character will naturally use each term
   - Plan natural integration points in narrative

### Step 2: Front Matter SEO Planning
**Before writing, plan your front matter:**

```yaml
topics: [
  "primary-topic",
  "LLM training",           # High-value term
  "neural network",        # High-value term
  "machine learning",      # High-value term
  "training data",         # High-value term
  "AI model",              # High-value term
  # ... 3-5 more relevant terms
]

description: "Character action. Learn about [KEYWORD] and [KEYWORD] through [KEYWORD]. [Natural sentence with 2-3 more keywords]."

tags: [
  "primary-topic",
  "LLM",                   # High-value term
  "neural networks",       # High-value term
  "AI training",           # High-value term
  # ... 5-7 more relevant terms
]
```

**SEO Checklist:**
- [ ] 8-12 high-value keywords identified
- [ ] Keywords mapped to character voices
- [ ] Front matter includes 5-8 relevant terms
- [ ] Description includes 3-5 keywords naturally
- [ ] Tags include 5-8 high-value search terms

---

## PHASE 2: WRITING (Natural Keyword Integration)

### Step 3: Write with Keywords in Mind
**During writing, naturally integrate keywords:**

**Vector's Natural Keyword Usage:**
- "That's how **neural networks** actually work!"
- "**LLMs** don't 'think'—they predict tokens!"
- "**AI hallucination** happens when..."
- "**Fine-tuning** is when you..."
- "**Transformer architecture** is the breakthrough..."

**Kai's Natural Keyword Usage:**
- "BEEP! **AI model** detection: 47%"
- "**Training dataset** contamination: 45%"
- "**Context window** utilization: 78%"
- "**Token limit** approaching: 3,847 of 4,096"

**Recurse's Natural Keyword Usage:**
- "*Investigating **neural network** patterns*"
- "*Found **training data** contamination*"
- "*Examining **AI model** behavior*"

**Human Blogger's Natural Keyword Usage:**
- "I was trying to use **ChatGPT** to..."
- "When I asked the **AI chatbot**..."
- "**AI prompts** that actually work..."

### Step 4: Keyword Density Check
**After first draft:**

- [ ] 3-5 high-value keywords appear in first 200 words
- [ ] Keywords appear naturally in character dialogue
- [ ] No keyword stuffing (sounds forced)
- [ ] Keywords serve narrative, not just SEO
- [ ] At least 8-12 different high-value terms used throughout

---

## PHASE 3: POST-WRITING (SEO Optimization)

### Step 5: Front Matter Optimization
**Enhance front matter with discovered keywords:**

1. **Review content** for terms that appeared naturally
2. **Add to topics/tags** if missing
3. **Enhance description** with 2-3 more keywords
4. **Ensure slug** includes primary keyword if possible

**Example Enhancement:**
```yaml
# BEFORE
topics: ["synthetic data", "model collapse"]
description: "Characters investigate synthetic data."

# AFTER
topics: ["synthetic data", "model collapse", "LLM training", "neural network degradation", "training dataset contamination", "machine learning"]
description: "Recurse discovers LLMs training on other AI models' outputs. Learn how synthetic data causes neural network degradation and model collapse in machine learning systems."
```

### Step 6: Content Keyword Enhancement
**Strategic additions that maintain character voice:**

1. **Find 2-3 spots** where adding a keyword feels natural
2. **Bold important terms** for emphasis (also helps SEO)
3. **Add long-tail phrases** in natural dialogue
4. **Check for question-based phrases** (people search these)

**Example:**
```markdown
# BEFORE
Models training on other models creates problems.

# AFTER
**LLMs** training on OTHER **AI models'** outputs creates a feedback loop!
```

### Step 7: Meta Optimization
**Final SEO polish:**

- [ ] Title includes primary keyword
- [ ] Description includes 3-5 keywords naturally
- [ ] Topics array has 5-8 high-value terms
- [ ] Tags array has 5-8 high-value terms
- [ ] Slug is keyword-friendly
- [ ] Image alt text includes keywords (if relevant)

## PHASE 4: QUALITY CHECK (SEO + Narrative)

### Step 8: SEO + Voice Balance Check
**Critical questions:**

1. **Does it read naturally?** (If not, remove forced keywords)
2. **Are keywords serving the story?** (If not, remove them)
3. **Would a reader notice keyword optimization?** (If yes, dial it back)
4. **Do characters sound like themselves?** (If not, fix voice)
5. **Are we hitting 8-12 high-value terms?** (If not, add naturally)

### Step 9: Final Review
**Before publishing:**

- [ ] SEO keyword integration complete (8-12 terms)
- [ ] Character voices maintained
- [ ] Narrative flow preserved
- [ ] Front matter optimized
- [ ] Description enhanced
- [ ] No keyword stuffing
- [ ] Natural integration throughout

## REMEMBER

**SEO is not separate from storytelling. It's part of it.**

- Keywords should enhance understanding
- Terms should feel natural to character voices
- Optimization should improve, not hurt, readability
- Every episode is an opportunity to help people find us

**The goal:** People searching for "how do LLMs work" or "what is AI hallucination" find our episodes because we naturally use those terms in character dialogue.
