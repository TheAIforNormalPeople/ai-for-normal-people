# CITATION & FACT-CHECKING RULES

## CLAIMS THAT REQUIRE SOURCES

Vector/Kai/Recurse MUST cite sources when making these types of claims:

### Statistics & Numbers:
❌ BAD: "Most AI models use transformer architecture"
✅ GOOD: "Most modern LLMs use transformer architecture (introduced in 'Attention is All You Need', Vaswani et al. 2017)"

❌ BAD: "ChatGPT has billions of parameters"
✅ GOOD: "GPT-4 is estimated to have over 1 trillion parameters (though OpenAI hasn't confirmed exact numbers)"

### Technical Claims:
❌ BAD: "AI uses pattern matching"
✅ GOOD: "LLMs work through statistical pattern matching across billions of parameters, predicting the most likely next token based on training data"

### Comparisons:
❌ BAD: "Claude is better at coding than ChatGPT"
✅ GOOD: "In benchmarks like HumanEval, Claude Sonnet scores ~73% while GPT-4 scores ~67% (as of Oct 2024), though real-world performance varies by task"

### Company Policies:
❌ BAD: "ChatGPT doesn't train on your data"
✅ GOOD: "OpenAI's policy (as of 2024) states they don't use ChatGPT conversations for training by default, but users can opt in"

## HOW TO CITE IN CHARACTER VOICE

Characters should cite naturally, not academically:

**Vector style:**
"The transformer architecture—from the 2017 'Attention is All You Need' paper—revolutionized how we process sequences!"

**Kai style:**
"BEEP! According to OpenAI's documentation (updated March 2024): GPT-4 context window = 128K tokens."

**Recurse style:**
"*Flips through OpenAI's privacy policy*

Says here they don't train on your chats by default. But the word 'default' is doing a lot of work..."

## WHEN TO SAY "I DON'T KNOW"

Characters should admit uncertainty:

❌ BAD: Making up specific numbers/dates
✅ GOOD: "The exact parameter count hasn't been confirmed—OpenAI keeps that private—but estimates range from..."

❌ BAD: Stating rumors as facts
✅ GOOD: "There are rumors about X, but no official confirmation. What we DO know is..."

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any episode, verify:

### Technical Claims:
- [ ] Check against official documentation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- [ ] Verify version numbers/dates are current
- [ ] Confirm benchmark scores if mentioned

### Statistics:
- [ ] Source provided or claim qualified ("estimated", "approximately")
- [ ] Numbers make logical sense
- [ ] Not contradicting recent updates

### Company Policies:
- [ ] Check privacy policy/terms of service
- [ ] Note when last verified (policies change)
- [ ] Link to official source when possible

### Technical Explanations:
- [ ] Accurate at a conceptual level
- [ ] Simplified but not wrong
- [ ] Could a developer verify this?
