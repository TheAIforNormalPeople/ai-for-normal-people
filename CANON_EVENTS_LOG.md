# 📚 CANON EVENTS LOG

**Purpose:** Track important character development moments, patterns, and canon events that affect future episodes.

## Character Development Patterns

### Vector's Holiday Decorating Pattern

**First Instance:** Episode 20 (Christmas Episode)
- Vector discovered Christmas traditions
- Decorated the blog with Christmas theme (red, green, gold, snow, etc.)
- This was the FIRST time Vector decorated for a holiday

**Second Instance:** Episode 19 (New Year's Episode) 
- Vector discovered New Year's traditions
- Decorated the blog with New Year's theme (gold, black, silver, confetti)
- Vector himself noticed this might be a pattern: "Wait. I just... I just decorated everything. Again. Like I did for Christmas. Is this... is this a pattern?"
- **Status:** Pattern emerging, not yet established (only 2 instances)
- **Character Awareness:** Vector is aware this might be a pattern but isn't sure yet
- **Human Awareness:** Human is surprised/confused by Vector's decorating behavior (doesn't expect it)

**Future Episodes:**
- If this becomes a running pattern, Vector will become more aware of it
- Human will eventually come to expect it
- But for now (Episode 19), it's still new and surprising

## Important Notes

- **Episode 19 is chronologically AFTER Episode 20** (due to missed days/holiday scheduling)
- Vector's decorating pattern is in early stages
- Characters are still discovering their own behaviors
- Log new patterns as they emerge
