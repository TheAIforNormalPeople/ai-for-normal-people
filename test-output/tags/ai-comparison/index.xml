&lt;span class="dialogue-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running tests. EXTENSIVE tests. &lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Claude&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gemini&lt;/strong&gt; - all three, side by side, same prompts, same tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s what I found: They&amp;rsquo;re DIFFERENT. Not better or worse necessarily, but DIFFERENT. Each one has strengths that make it better for specific things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt; is fast, creative, good at code. &lt;strong&gt;Claude&lt;/strong&gt; has longer context, more thoughtful responses, better at analysis. &lt;strong&gt;Gemini&lt;/strong&gt; is multimodal from the start, integrated with Google&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[Honest comparison of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
