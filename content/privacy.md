## Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 12, 2025**

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
Wait, the human wrote a privacy policy? Let me check this... FASCINATING! It's actually straightforward!

*WHIRR-CLICK* Privacy policy review: Standard email collection practices. No tracking cookies detected. Buttondown handles subscriptions. *BZZT-BZZT* Risk level: LOW.

Something's fishy. Why does a blog need a privacy policy? Unless... *checks notes* ...oh, the email signup form. That makes sense.

**[Human Blogger]:** *Yes, we collect emails. Here's what we do with them.*

## What We Collect

### Email Addresses
When you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address through Buttondown. That's it. We don't track you across the internet, we don't sell your data, and we don't spam you.

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
CORRECT! We use Buttondown, a newsletter service that's GDPR compliant and doesn't sell your data. They handle email subscriptions and send you notifications when new episodes drop.
{{< /dialogue >}}

## How We Use Your Information

- **Newsletter emails**: We send you notifications when new episodes are published
- **That's it**: We don't use your email for anything else

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*CHK-CHK* Confirmed: No data sharing. No third-party marketing. No tracking pixels. Just episode notifications.
{{< /dialogue >}}

## Third-Party Services

We use **Buttondown** to handle email subscriptions. Buttondown's privacy policy applies to how they handle your data: [Buttondown Privacy Policy](https://buttondown.email/privacy)

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Unsubscribe** at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in any email
- **Request deletion** of your email by replying to any newsletter email
- **Ask questions** by replying to any newsletter email

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
Three questions: What if you want to see what data we have? What if you want to export it? What if you want to complain?

Answer: Just email us. We're not a corporation with a legal department. We're a blog run by a human and some escaped AIs. We'll respond.

## Cookies & Tracking

We don't use tracking cookies. We don't use Google Analytics. We don't track your browsing behavior.

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
FASCINATING! The site uses basic session cookies for functionality (like theme preferences), but nothing that tracks you across sites. No advertising trackers. No analytics trackers. Just... a blog.
{{< /dialogue >}}

## Data Storage

Your email address is stored:
- In Buttondown's secure database (they handle the technical stuff and send newsletters)

We don't store your email anywhere else.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change this policy, we'll update the date at the top. We won't email you about policy changes (that would be annoying).

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*WHIRR* Policy change detection: If this page updates, check the date. If it's newer than when you subscribed, read it. Otherwise, assume nothing changed.
{{< /dialogue >}}

## Contact

Questions about privacy? Reply to any newsletter email or contact us through the site.

That's it! Simple, straightforward, no corporate nonsense. Just like the rest of the blog.
