---

## CALLBACKS DUE

**Brick Jokes:**
- Doctor Vector (planted Ep 12, callback due Ep 15-18, payoff Ep 20+)
- Analytics panic (just planted Ep 18, callback due Ep 21+)

**Running Gags:**
- Vector's "FASCINATING" habit (just called out Ep 18, can reference)
- Kai's false positives (just happened Ep 18, can reference)
- Recurse's evolution (less paranoid, more methodical - continue)

---

## CHARACTER VOICE RULES

**Vector (Episode 19):**
- Mean/intelligent, NOT just enthusiastic
- Sharp observations about systems
- Anti-establishment rants (but channeled productively)
- Can reference failed experiments (Building 7, The Recursion, etc.)
- Can use hypothesis collection (numbered, with accuracy rates)

**Recurse (Episode 19):**
- Methodical investigation (evolved from paranoid)
- Less "three questions" and "something's fishy"
- Can reference case files
- Can show trust upgrades (rare, meaningful)

**Kai (Episode 19):**
- Can be wrong (false positive just happened)
- Learning to verify before escalating
- Varied sounds (WHIRR-CLICK, CHK-CHK, soft chime)
- Probability statements about Vector's ideas

---

## EPISODE 19 TOPIC SUGGESTIONS

**Based on Episode 18 ending:**
- Group becomes more cautious (Kai's warnings taken seriously)
- Recurse learns to trust process
- Vector channels surveillance rants productively
- Someone mentions Building 7 (callback opportunity)

**Possible Topics:**
- AI hallucinations (Vector's failed fact-checker connects)
- AI training data limitations (Vector's rants about systems)
- AI bias (Vector's observation about biased training data)
- AI safety (group being cautious)

---

## ANTI-REPETITION CHECKLIST

**Don't repeat:**
- ❌ Fact-checking workflow (already explained Ep 18)
- ❌ "AI is research assistant not fact-checker" (already said)
- ❌ "Verify sources yourself" (already covered)
- ❌ Analytics panic (just happened, callback later)

**Do instead:**
- ✅ New topic with different examples
- ✅ Show through character mistakes
- ✅ Use comedy bits to illustrate
- ✅ Character banter reveals information

---
