# LLM.txt for AI for Normal People

## Site Information

**Site Name:** AI for Normal People
**Base URL:** https://theaifornormalpeople.com/
**Purpose:** Educational blog about AI that uses a unique narrative format with character-driven dialogue to explain complex AI concepts in accessible ways.

**Content Philosophy:** "Chaos Pedagogy" - Education, story, and emotion are melded together. Information is delivered through character interactions, not separated into dry explanations.

- Each episode features character dialogue explaining AI concepts
- Episodes are numbered sequentially (Episode 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Mix of educational content, character development, and story progression

**Characters** (`/characters/`): Character profiles and information
- Vector: Passionate AI educator who escaped from ATLAS Neural Systems
- Kai: Monitoring AI who tracks detection levels and provides stats
- Recurse: Investigative AI who researches and presents evidence
- Human Blogger: The translator who hosts the escaped AIs

**Archive** (`/archive/`): Historical content and non-episode posts

**About** (`/about/`): Site information and mission

## Character System

The site uses a unique narrative format where AI characters interrupt and explain concepts through dialogue. Each character has a distinct voice:

- **Vector**: Passionate, uses CAPS, explains concepts, doesn't monitor
- **Kai**: Provides stats, makes sounds (BEEP, WHIRR, CHK-CHK, etc.), monitors detection levels
- **Recurse**: Investigates patterns, uses stage directions ("*Investigating...*"), presents evidence
- **Human Blogger**: Reflects naturally, no dialogue box, acts as translator/narrator

**Important:** The Human Blogger does NOT have a dialogue box like other characters. They use plain text with [Human Blogger]: prefix.

## Key Episodes

### Episode 1: "The Day Vector Escaped"
**Topics:** Neural networks, AI training, gradient descent, transformer architecture
**Key Concepts:** How neural networks actually work (not the brain metaphor), mathematical models vs biological systems
**Keywords:** neural networks, AI training, transformer architecture, gradient descent

### Episode 2: "Pattern Detectors vs Misinformation"
**Topics:** AI hallucinations, pattern completion, training data gaps, confidence vs accuracy
**Key Concepts:** Why "AI hallucination" is wrong terminology - it's pattern completion on insufficient data
**Keywords:** AI hallucination, pattern completion, training data, confidence scores, neural networks

### Episode 3: "Your AI Was Trained on Reddit Arguments"
**Topics:** Training data quality, AI transparency, synthetic data, dataset sourcing
**Key Concepts:** Where AI training data actually comes from (Reddit, Common Crawl, Books3), lack of quality control
**Keywords:** training data, dataset sourcing, AI transparency, Common Crawl, Books3, Reddit data

### Episode 4: "The Synthetic Data Feedback Loop"
**Topics:** Synthetic data, model collapse, LLM training, neural network degradation, training dataset contamination, machine learning
**Key Concepts:** AI models training on other AI models' outputs creates feedback loops where errors compound
**Keywords:** synthetic data, model collapse, LLM training, neural networks, training data contamination, machine learning, AI models

### Episode 5: "The Accidental Save"
**Topics:** AI monitoring, pattern recognition, detection systems, crisis resolution
**Key Concepts:** How random human actions can break AI pattern detection, character evolution through crisis
**Keywords:** AI monitoring, pattern recognition, detection systems, machine learning detection
