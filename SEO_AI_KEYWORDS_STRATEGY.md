# SEO AI Keywords Strategy Guide

## Philosophy: Natural Integration Through Character Voice

**Key Principle:** Never keyword stuff. Every term must serve the narrative and character voice. Vector explains concepts passionately. Kai monitors with stats. Recurse investigates patterns. The Human Blogger reflects naturally.

## Character Voice Mapping

### Vector (Passionate Explainer)
**Natural phrases that include keywords:**
- "That's how **neural networks** actually work!"
- "**LLMs** aren't magic—they're pattern matching at scale!"
- "**AI hallucination** happens when the model..."
- "**Fine-tuning** is when you..."
- "**Transformer architecture** is the breakthrough that..."
- "**RLHF** is how we teach AI to be helpful..."

**Example integration:**
```
{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
NO! That's not how **neural networks** work!

**LLMs** don't "think"—they predict the next token based on patterns in their **training data**!

When you see **AI hallucination**, it's because the model is generating plausible-sounding text that doesn't match reality!

{{< /dialogue >}}
```

### Kai (Stats & Monitoring)
**Natural phrases:**
- "BEEP! **AI model** detection: 47%"
- "**Training dataset** contamination rate: 45%"
- "**Context window** utilization: 78%"
- "**Token limit** approaching: 3,847 of 4,096"
- "**Inference** time: 1.2 seconds"

**Example integration:**
```
{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
BEEP! **LLM** detection spike: 52%!

**Context window** nearly full. **Token count**: 3,891 of 4,096.

**AI model** signature detected in output patterns.

{{< /dialogue >}}
```

### Recurse (Investigator)
**Natural phrases:**
- "*Investigating **neural network** patterns*"
- "*Pulls up **training data** analysis*"
- "*Found **AI hallucination** instances: 23*"
- "*Examining **transformer architecture** logs*"
- "*Cross-referencing **fine-tuning** parameters*"

**Example integration:**
```
{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating **AI model** behavior patterns*

Found something. **Training data** contamination correlates with **AI hallucination** rates.

*Pulls up **neural network** activation maps*

The **transformer architecture** is amplifying errors in contaminated data.

{{< /dialogue >}}
```

### Human Blogger (Natural Reflection)
**Natural phrases:**
- "I was trying to use **ChatGPT** to..."
- "When I asked the **AI chatbot**..."
- "**AI prompts** that actually work..."
- "**AI tools** I've been testing..."
- "**AI writing** feels different when..."

**Example integration:**
```
[Human Blogger]: *Trying to use **ChatGPT** to research this topic, but it keeps giving me corporate speak.*

*The **AI chatbot** doesn't understand I need the real explanation, not the marketing version.*

*I need better **AI prompts** that cut through the BS.*
```

## Episode-Specific Integration Opportunities

### Episode 4 (Synthetic Data) - Already Good, Can Enhance:
- ✅ "synthetic data" - Using well
- ✅ "model collapse" - Using well
- ✅ "data contamination" - Using well
- ➕ Add: "**LLM training** on synthetic outputs"
- ➕ Add: "**neural network** degradation"
- ➕ Add: "**training dataset** contamination"
- ➕ Add: "**AI model** feedback loops"

### Episode 5 (Monitoring/Crisis) - Opportunities:
- ➕ "**AI monitoring** systems"
- ➕ "**pattern recognition** algorithms"
- ➕ "**machine learning** detection"
- ➕ "**neural network** signatures"
- ➕ "**AI model** fingerprinting"

### Future Episodes - Keyword Opportunities:
- **Episode 6+**: "**AI hallucination**" - Perfect Vector topic
- **Episode 7+**: "**prompt engineering**" - How to talk to AI
- **Episode 8+**: "**fine-tuning**" - Customizing models
- **Episode 9+**: "**RLHF**" - Training methods
- **Episode 10+**: "**transformer architecture**" - How it works

## Natural Integration Examples

### ❌ Bad (Keyword Stuffing):
```
{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
**AI chatbot** using **machine learning** with **neural networks** trained on **training data** through **fine-tuning** processes creates **AI hallucination** in **LLM** models.

{{< /dialogue >}}
```

### ✅ Good (Natural Character Voice):
```
{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
That **AI chatbot** answer is wrong!

**LLMs** trained on contaminated **training data** develop **AI hallucination** patterns. The **neural network** learns to generate plausible-sounding nonsense!

**Fine-tuning** on synthetic outputs makes it worse—the model gets better at being confidently wrong!

{{< /dialogue >}}
```
