# Episode Numbering Status

## Current Situation (Dec 26, 2025)

### Posted Episodes
- **Episode 18:** Dec 23, 2025 - "AI for Fact-Checking (And Its Limits)" ✅
- **Episode 20:** Dec 26, 2025 - "The Holiday Break (And What AI Does When You're Not Looking)" ✅ (Holiday episode)

- **Episode 21:** Dec 27, 2025 - "Using AI to Organize Your Thoughts" (draft: false) ✅ **READY FOR TOMORROW**

## What Happened

**Dec 24-25:** Human missed posts (holiday break)
**Dec 26:** Created Episode 20 as holiday special covering the missed days

## Episode Numbering Plan

### Option 1: Keep Current Numbering (Recommended)
- Episode 19 stays as Episode 19 (Dec 24 content, but posted later)
- Episode 20 (old) → Renumber to Episode 22 or later
- Episode 21 stays as Episode 21 (ready for Dec 27)

### Option 2: Shift Everything
- Episode 19 → Keep as 19
- Episode 20 (old) → Renumber to 21
- Episode 21 (current) → Renumber to 22
- All future episodes shift +1

## Recommended Action

**Keep Episode 20 as the holiday episode** (it's already posted and works perfectly as a special episode).

**For the old Episode 20 ("AI Content Creation Tools Comparison"):**
- Renumber to Episode 22 or later (after checking what episodes 22+ are)
- Update date to match when it should be posted
- Update slug accordingly

**Episode 21 is ready for Dec 27** - no changes needed.

## Files to Update (When Ready)

1. `episode-20-ai-content-creation-tools-comparison.md`
   - Rename file to `episode-22-ai-content-creation-tools-comparison.md` (or appropriate number)
   - Update front matter:
     - `episode_number: 22` (or appropriate)
     - `slug: "episode-22-ai-content-creation-tools-comparison"`
     - `date: [appropriate date]`
