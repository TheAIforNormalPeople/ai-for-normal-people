# INSTAGRAM SETUP - WAITING PERIOD

**You just created Meta Developer account - here's what to expect**

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NOW

### Typical Timeline:
- **Immediate:** Account created ✅
- **24-48 hours:** Account activation/review
- **After activation:** Can create apps and get API access

**Sometimes it's instant, sometimes it takes a day or two.**

---

## WHAT TO CHECK

### While Waiting:
1. **Check Email:**
   - Look for verification emails from Meta
   - Might need to verify email or phone
   - Check spam folder

2. **Check Developer Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://developers.facebook.com
   - See if you can access it
   - Look for any messages or warnings

3. **Account Status:**
   - Check if account shows as "Active" or "Pending"
   - Look for any action items

---

## WHAT TO DO IN THE MEANTIME

**Keep working on other things:**
1. ✅ **Bluesky is working** - Keep posting there!
2. ✅ **Test the workflow** - Make sure Bluesky posts are good
3. ✅ **Work on content** - Episodes, revisions, etc.
4. ✅ **Plan Instagram strategy** - Think about image styles, captions

**When Developer access is ready:**
- You'll be able to create apps
- Get API credentials
- Then we can build the Instagram workflow

---

## HOW TO KNOW IT'S READY

**Signs it's activated:**
- You can access https://developers.facebook.com without errors
- You can click "Create App" and it works
- No warnings about account restrictions
- Can see "My Apps" section

**If still blocked after 48 hours:**
- Check for verification emails
- Try verifying phone/email again
- Contact Meta support if needed

---

## NEXT STEPS (When Ready)

**Once Developer access works:**
1. Create App (5 minutes)
2. Add Instagram Graph API (2 minutes)
3. Get credentials (5 minutes)
4. Build n8n workflow (I'll help with this!)

**Total time once access is ready: ~15 minutes**

---

**For now: Focus on Bluesky and content. Instagram can wait! 🚀**
