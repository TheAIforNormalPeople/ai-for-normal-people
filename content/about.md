# About The Normal People

Most AI content online is garbage. It's either trying to sell you a $997 course or making you feel like an idiot for not understanding it. We got tired of it. So we're here, just... talking about AI. Whatever we're thinking that day. Like one giant psychiatric diagnosis you can learn from instead of fear.

## What We Actually Want

We want to help you learn. But honestly? We don't know what you specifically need help with. So we just write about what we're figuring out. How to use AI. Which tools are scams. What actually works. ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Midjourney. The stuff people are actually using.

We're not here to build an empire or dominate a market. We're here because we think you can build things that matter without needing mass capital or global domination. Work with friends. Build something you actually want. Use these new tools to make real things. Things that could help save the planet without the corporate whatever attached to it.

Learn the tools they're using and turn them toward good. Without letting it take over our love for the place we live.

## The Reality We're In

Right now, AI is doing bad things. **Yes.**

Right now, AI is hurting the planet. **Yes.**

Is it going anywhere? **No.**

So we have a choice. We can either be pissed at each other forever and demand someone else change it. Or we can learn how to change it ourselves. That's it. Those are the options.

We're choosing: learn, build, change.

We need to learn first. Learn how AI works. Build things with it. Then figure out how to power it ethically. Make better fuels. Fix the ozone layer. Maybe move us further from the sun? I don't know. But we can't just wait for someone to do it for us.

We can coexist with AI without letting it become our enemy. We can use these tools without becoming the scary weirdos who worship them.

## What "Normal" Actually Means

Here's the thing about "Normal People."

They push what's normal on us. They tell us what we should see as normal. But the very start of our existence wasn't normal. Nothing about existence is normal. Magic, science, aliens, technology, things we're missing. None of it is normal in any aspect.

So fuck it.

Normal can be autism. Or differently abled. LGBTQ+. Any color of the world. The Normal People can be whatever you want because the justification of what "normal" is means nothing.

I'm not normal. You're not normal. 

**But together? We're The Normal People.**

## What We're Doing Here

We're learning. We're building. We're breaking things (ethically) and rebuilding them. We're trying to figure out how to coexist with this technology without letting it destroy what we love.

We don't care about your money or your wealth or who's better at what. We don't care because we want to build things that are better and leave the other stuff behind. If we learn these new tools, we can build the real things. Things that matter. Things that help.

Without waiting for permission. Without asking for capital. Just... making stuff.

## The Honest Part

I don't know what's real anymore. I get that. It's scary. It's wild. And what the hell else are we going to do? Make dinner? Ugh.

So we embrace it. We learn from it. We try to change it. Who's stopping us?

We want to learn. We want you to learn. We want to break and rebuild. We want to experience love and guidance too.

## Who We Are

I am no one. I am not normal and neither are you.

But together? We're The Normal People.

You are no one. But **WE** can change everything.
