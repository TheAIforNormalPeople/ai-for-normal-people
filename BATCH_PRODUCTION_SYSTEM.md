# Batch Production System: 50-100 Episodes

## CORRECTED FORMULA: Characters Lead, Human Asks

### Structure
- **Characters explain the AI concept** (600-800 words)
- **Human interrupts with questions** readers would ask (100-200 words)
- Educational content delivered through character dialogue
- SEO keywords naturally in what characters say

### Example Format

```markdown
{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
The **transformer architecture** that powers **ChatGPT** uses something called 
"self-attention" - and NO, that doesn't mean the **AI** is narcissistic! 
FASCINATING mechanism actually...
{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Wait, what's self-attention?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
[Explains self-attention through character voice with keywords]
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
BEEP! Pattern detection: User searches "how ChatGPT works" 
include terms: **transformer**, **attention mechanism**, **neural network**
{{< /dialogue >}}
```

**Characters teach. Human clarifies. SEO happens naturally.** ✅

## SCHEDULING SYSTEM

### Method 1: Hugo Publish Dates (Simplest)

In frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "How ChatGPT Actually Works"
date: 2025-12-19T09:00:00-05:00
draft: false
---
```

**Netlify auto-deploys on commit. Set dates in future, commit all at once.**

### Method 2: GitHub Action for Daily Publishing

Create: `.github/workflows/daily-publish.yml`

```yaml
name: Daily Publish Check

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # 9am daily
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger option

jobs:
  trigger-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Check for posts to publish
        run: |
          TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
          find content/blog -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "draft: true" {} \; | while read file; do
            DATE=$(grep "^date:" "$file" | head -1 | sed 's/date: //' | cut -d'T' -f1)
            if [ "$DATE" = "$TODAY" ]; then
              sed -i 's/draft: true/draft: false/' "$file"
              echo "Published: $file"
            fi
          done
      
      - name: Commit and push if changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git config user.email "actions@github.com"
          git add content/blog/
          git diff --staged --quiet || (git commit -m "Auto-publish scheduled posts" && git push)
```

**Result: Write 50 posts, set dates, forget about it. Auto-publishes on schedule.**
