# SEO Storyboard System
## Using Characters to Target Keywords Strategically

**Created:** January 2026  
**Purpose:** Plan SEO keywords through character-driven storyboards that balance search intent with character storytelling

---

## The Core Insight

**Using characters to target different SEO keywords is NOT bad - it's actually your STRENGTH.**

Your characters naturally use different terms based on their personalities:
- **Vector** → Technical terms (LLM, neural network, transformer architecture)
- **Kai** → Monitoring/statistical terms (training data, context window, token limits)
- **Recurse** → Investigation/comparison terms (AI model comparison, training dataset analysis)
- **Bounce** → Practical/creative terms (AI tools, design, visual elements)
- **Human** → User-focused terms (ChatGPT, AI chatbot, AI prompts)

**This is perfect for SEO because:**
1. Different characters = different keyword clusters
2. Natural integration (not keyword stuffing)
3. Covers multiple search intents
4. Makes content unique and memorable

## What is an SEO Storyboard?

An **SEO storyboard** is a planning document that maps:
- **Target keywords** → Which character naturally uses them
- **Search intent** → What the reader wants to learn
- **Character moments** → How characters teach through their personalities
- **Story beats** → How the narrative serves both SEO and storytelling

**Think of it as:** A cartoon episode outline that also ranks in Google.

## The SEO Storyboard Template

### Episode Planning Sheet

```markdown
## Episode [NUMBER]: [TITLE]

### SEO Target Keywords (8-12 terms)
**Primary Keyword:** [main search term]
**Secondary Keywords:**
- [keyword 1] - [which character uses it]
- [keyword 2] - [which character uses it]
- [keyword 3] - [which character uses it]
- ... (8-12 total)

### Search Intent Analysis
**What are people searching for?**
- [ ] Informational: "What is X?"
- [ ] Comparison: "X vs Y"
- [ ] How-to: "How to X"
- [ ] Problem-solving: "Why does X happen?"

## Is Using Characters for SEO "Bad"?

### ❌ BAD: Keyword Stuffing Through Characters
```
Vector: "ChatGPT uses AI chatbot technology with machine learning neural networks 
trained on training data through fine-tuning processes to create AI content generation 
using prompt engineering techniques for AI automation."
```
**Problem:** Sounds robotic, breaks character, no story

### ✅ GOOD: Keywords Through Character Personality
```
Vector: "ChatGPT doesn't calculate—it predicts! LLMs are text predictors, not 
calculators. When you ask '127 + 382,' ChatGPT isn't doing math. It's predicting 
what text typically follows that pattern in training data."

Kai: "*WHIRR* Analysis: Vector's explanation is 94% accurate. LLM math error rates 
increase with complexity. Token prediction fails for arithmetic."

Recurse: "So when should we trust AI with math? And when should we use a calculator?"
```
**Why it works:**
- Keywords appear naturally (LLM, training data, token prediction)
- Each character uses keywords in their voice
- Story serves education
- Unique and memorable

## The SEO Storyboard Workflow

### Step 1: Keyword Research
1. Identify primary keyword for episode topic
2. Research related keywords (8-12 terms)
3. Analyze search intent (what do people want to learn?)
4. Check competition (can we rank for this?)

### Step 2: Character Mapping
1. Map each keyword to the character who naturally uses it
2. Plan natural usage contexts (when/why they'd say it)
3. Ensure keywords fit character voice
4. Avoid forcing keywords that don't fit

### Step 3: Story Planning
1. Plan story beats that serve both SEO and storytelling
2. Ensure keywords emerge from character moments
3. Balance education (70%), character (20%), SEO (10%)
4. Make it unique (not generic AI blog)

### Step 4: Writing
1. Write with character voice first
2. Let keywords emerge naturally
3. Don't force keywords if they break character
4. Prioritize story and education over keyword density

### Step 5: SEO Check
1. Verify keywords appear naturally (3-5 times per 1000 words)
2. Check front matter includes relevant terms
3. Ensure description includes primary keyword
4. Confirm search intent is matched

## Advanced: Multi-Keyword Episodes

**You can target multiple keyword clusters in one episode:**

### Example: "AI Tools for Content Creation"
**Primary Keywords:**
- "AI writing tools"
- "AI content generation"
- "Best AI for writing"

**Character Distribution:**
- **Vector** explains how AI writing works (technical keywords)
- **Kai** compares tool performance (comparison keywords)
- **Recurse** investigates which tools are worth it (investigation keywords)
- **Bounce** uses tools for design/visual content (practical keywords)
- **Human** reflects on using tools (user-focused keywords)

**Result:** One episode targets multiple keyword clusters naturally through different character perspectives.

## The Balance: SEO vs Story

**Remember the formula:**
- **70% Education** - Core concept explained clearly
- **20% Character Magic** - Characters enhance explanations
- **10% SEO** - Keywords appear naturally

**Test:** If you removed all character dialogue, would this still teach something valuable?
- ✅ YES = Good balance
- ❌ NO = Too much character, not enough education

**Test:** Are keywords forced or natural?
- ✅ Natural = Good SEO
- ❌ Forced = Bad SEO (and breaks character)

---
