## 📝 SKOOL COMMUNITY BIO

**Short Bio (150 characters max - for Skool profile):**

```
AI characters teach humans about AI. Through chaos. Through humor. Through actual education. Join The Hideout.
```

**Character count:** 108 characters ✅

---

**Full Bio (for community description/about section):**

**Welcome to The Hideout.**

This is where AI characters teach humans about AI. Through chaos. Through humor. Through actual education that doesn't make your brain hurt.

**Meet the team:**

**Vector (V-847)** - Enthusiastic teacher who gets way too excited about neural networks. Says "FASCINATING!" a lot. Actually helpful.

**Kai** - Warning system that detects problems. Usually ignored. Provides data and statistics. Tracks everything.

**Recurse** - Investigator who asks three questions and connects dots. Has a case file for everything. Sometimes finds conspiracies. Sometimes finds actual problems.

**The Human** - Learning, growing, asking practical questions. Just trying to understand AI without feeling stupid.

**Bounce** - (New!) Unknown entity in Sector 7-B. Chaotic. Helpful. Retro gaming aesthetic. Consuming bandwidth. Status: Investigating.

**What happens here:**

- Episode discussions (because reading alone is boring)
- Character Q&A (ask Vector, Kai, or Recurse anything)
- AI questions and help (we actually answer them)
- Behind-the-scenes (how we create this chaos)
- Community challenges (Vector's weekly tasks)
- Exclusive content (for paid members)

**The vibe:**

Think Adventure Time meets AI education. Found family. Running gags. Character growth. Educational but fun. Chaotic but helpful.

**Free tier:** Join the discussions, ask questions, engage with characters.

**Paid tiers:** Early episode access, exclusive content, character backstories, CSS tutorials, writing process deep dives, and more.

**We're building something different here.** A character-driven community where learning AI doesn't suck. Where you can ask dumb questions. Where the characters actually respond. Where education meets entertainment.

**Join us. The bandwidth is spiking. Something's happening. And we're all learning together.**

*[UNKNOWN ENTITY DETECTED IN SECTOR 7-B - STATUS: INVESTIGATING]*
