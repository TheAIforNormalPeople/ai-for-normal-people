Episodes where Recurse appears but doesn't use "*Flips through notes*":
- Episode 7
- Episode 8
- Episode 9
- Episode 10
- Episode 11
- Episode 12
- Episode 13
- Episode 14
- Episode 15

**Action Required:** Add "*Flips through notes*" to Recurse's dialogue in these episodes

---

## BANNED PHRASES

### Found:
- Episode 7: "ecosystem" (line 117)

### All Others:

## FRONTMATTER DETECTION

**Note:** The script is reporting "Missing frontmatter" but all episodes have frontmatter. This appears to be a false positive in the script's detection logic. The frontmatter is actually present in all files.

## PRIORITY FIXES

### High Priority (Must Fix):
1. **Episode 7:** Remove "ecosystem" (banned phrase)

### Medium Priority (Should Fix):
2. **Episodes 7-15:** Add "*Flips through notes*" to Recurse's dialogue
3. **Episodes 9-15:** Trim word count (currently 1473-1673 words, target: 1000-1200)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
4. **Episodes 6, 8, 19-25:** Trim slightly if possible (currently 1305-1409 words)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Fix Episode 7 immediately** - Replace "ecosystem" with "Google's services" or "Google's platform"

2. **Add Recurse note-flipping** to episodes 7-15 where Recurse appears

3. **Consider trimming longer episodes** - Episodes 9-15 are 300-500 words over target. Consider:
   - Removing redundant explanations
   - Consolidating similar points
   - Tightening dialogue

4. **Word count flexibility** - Episodes 16-25 are generally better (most in range or only slightly over). Episodes 6-15 need more trimming.

---

## VALIDATION SCRIPT STATUS

✅ Script is working correctly:
- Detecting banned phrases
- Checking character voices
- Validating word count
- Checking structure

⚠️ Minor issue:
- Frontmatter detection reports false positive (but frontmatter is actually present)

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix Episode 7 (remove "ecosystem")
2. Add Recurse note-flipping to episodes 7-15
3. Consider trimming episodes 9-15 for word count
4. Re-run validation after fixes
