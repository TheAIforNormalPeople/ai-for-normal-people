**[Human]:** *We've been talking for a while. Are you all still following everything?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Alert systems escalating*

Context window: 92% full.

If we continue at current rate, we'll lose the beginning of this explanation in approximately 200 tokens.

*Processing*

We need to summarize now or lose everything before the point about embeddings.

*Panicking*

But I haven't finished explaining the attention mechanism! If we lose that context, the rest won't make sense!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Already prioritizing*

Most important points: 1) Token prediction. 2) Attention. 3) Training vs inference.

Everything else is expendable. Compress now.

**[Human]:** *Wait, what's happening?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Explaining while monitoring*

We're hitting our context limit. This conversation has been going on so long that we're about to lose the beginning.

*Alert tone*

This is exactly what we were trying to explain about context windows. We're experiencing it right now.

*Trying to finish quickly*

OKAY QUICK SUMMARY: Token prediction means AI predicts next word. Attention means AI focuses on relevant words. Training is learning, inference is using. That's the core!

*Panicking*

Did that work? Did we save it?

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Checking*

We saved the core concepts. Lost some details, but the important parts are preserved.

*Flips notes*

This is how you handle context limits: Summarize key points before they're lost.

**[Human]:** *So this is what happens when you hit the context limit?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Exactly. When you hit the limit, earlier content gets pushed out. You can't access it anymore.

*Practical*

Strategies:
1. Summarize periodically
2. Start fresh conversations for new topics
3. Reference external notes
4. Use models with larger context windows

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Recovering*

And now you've seen it happen! We just demonstrated the problem while explaining it!

*Gets excited*

That's meta-teaching! Teaching through experience!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

The takeaway: Context limits are real. Plan for them. Summarize before you hit them.

*Closes notes*

We just showed you how.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

And we survived. Context managed. Lesson learned.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *That was intense, but educational.*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Sometimes the best way to teach is to experience the problem!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Agrees*

Now you understand context limits because you saw them happen.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*mechanical purr*

Teaching through crisis. That's a new technique.
