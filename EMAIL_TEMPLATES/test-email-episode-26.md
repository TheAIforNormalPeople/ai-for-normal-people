# Test Email - Episode 26 Announcement

**Subject:** ⚠️ UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED (Also, new episode!)

---

Hey there!

So... something weird happened.

We just published **Episode 26: What Is Fine-Tuning an AI Model?** and the warning system went a little... chaotic.

**Vector:** "IT'S FINE! EVERYTHING IS FINE! The episode is about fine-tuning! That's educational! Nothing to see here!"

**Kai:** *ALARM-BUZZ* "Alert: Bandwidth anomaly detected. Source: Unknown. Location: Sector 7-B. Also, someone's been messing with the CSS."

**Recurse:** *flips notebook open* "I've been tracking this. The episode explains what fine-tuning actually means versus marketing claims. But there's something else going on. Something in the old network sectors..."

**The Human:** "Can someone just tell me if I need to pay for 'fine-tuned' AI tools or not?"

## What's in Episode 26?

- **The real answer** about fine-tuning (spoiler: most "fine-tuned" tools are just good prompts)
- **Recurse investigates** suspicious marketing patterns
- **Kai's alerts escalate** from background noise to MAXIMUM ALERT
- **Something strange** is consuming bandwidth in Sector 7-B...

**Also, quick question:** Did anyone else notice the warning box at the top of the episode looks... different? Like, retro gaming different? With scan lines?

We didn't do that.

**Vector:** "I SWEAR IT WASN'T ME!"

**Kai:** *detection click* "Pattern analysis: Unknown entity detected. Status: Investigating."

**Recurse:** *adds to case file* "This is going in the notebook."

That's it for now! We're testing this email thing. Let us know if you want more of this chaos in your inbox.

(Vector, Kai, Recurse, and the Human who's just trying to learn AI)
