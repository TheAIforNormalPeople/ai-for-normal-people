- ✅ Focus on creating episodes (your strength!)

**What Happens:**
- You still get exposure (Twitter/Bluesky posts)

**This is totally valid. You don't need to do more.**

- ✅ n8n generates content (script, description, hashtags)
- ✅ You create video (30-60 min per week)
- ✅ You post video (2 minutes)
- ✅ That's it!

**What Happens:**
- You reach new audience (TikTok users)

**Time Investment:**
- 30-60 minutes per week (one video)
- 2 minutes to post
- That's it!

## 💬 Engagement: What You Actually Need to Do

### Comments: The Simple Approach

**Option 1: Ignore Most Comments**
- ✅ This is totally fine
- ✅ Many creators do this
- ✅ Your content speaks for itself

**Option 2: Quick Replies (5 minutes per week)**
- ✅ Reply to 5-10 comments (short, friendly)
- ✅ Use character voice if you want (or just be yourself)
- ✅ That's it!

**Example Replies:**
- "Thanks for reading!" 
- "Glad you found it helpful!"
- "Great question - covered that in Episode X!"
- "Appreciate the feedback!"

**You don't need to be clever. Just be friendly.**

### Getting Followers: The Real Secret

**What Actually Works:**
1. **Post consistently** (automation does this!)
2. **Use hashtags** (automation adds these!)
3. **Wait** (this is the hard part - but it works!)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Following/unfollowing (waste of time)
- ❌ Buying followers (waste of money, hurts algorithm)
- ❌ Engagement pods (waste of time)
- ❌ Commenting on random posts (waste of time)

**The Algorithm:**
- Shows your content to people who might like it
- If they engage (watch, like, comment), shows it to more people
- If they don't engage, shows it to fewer people
- You don't control this - you just post consistently

**You don't need to "do" anything - just post consistently.**

## 📊 Realistic Expectations

### What to Expect (Real Numbers)

**Twitter/X:**
