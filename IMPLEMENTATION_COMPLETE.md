- Free of generic AI language
- Factually accurate with proper citations
- Consistently formatted
- Entertaining and educational
- Character-driven storytelling

✅ **banned-phrases.txt** - 50+ banned generic AI phrases  
✅ **citation-rules.md** - Fact-checking and source citation guidelines  
✅ **style-guide.md** - Complete formatting and style standards

### Scripts (scripts/)
✅ **validate-episode.sh** - Automated validation script

### Documentation
✅ **QUALITY_CONTROL_MASTER.md** - Complete quality control workflow  
✅ **ARTIST_STORYTELLER_SYSTEM.md** - Creative storytelling approach  
✅ **CURSOR_MASTER_GENERATION_PROMPT.md** - Master prompt for Cursor  
✅ **QUALITY_CONTROL_SYSTEM_LOG.md** - Implementation tracking  
✅ **QUALITY_CONTROL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Complete summary  
✅ **README_QUALITY_CONTROL.md** - Quick start guide

## SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### 1. Anti-Generic-AI Validation
- Banned phrases list (opening hooks, transitions, corporate speak, etc.)
- Automated detection via script
- Must remove and rewrite if found

### 2. Fact-Checking & Source Citation
- Citation rules for statistics, technical claims, comparisons, policies
- Character-voice citation styles
- Uncertainty handling ("estimated", "approximately")
- Verification checklist

### 3. Consistent Styling & Formatting
- Exact frontmatter format
- Required structure (Opening → Interruption → Teaching → Takeaway)
- Dialogue formatting rules
- Human narration format
- Spacing and paragraph rules

### 4. Character Voice Consistency
- Vector: CAPS, exclamation marks, interrupts self
- Kai: BEEP! prefix, exact statistics, monitoring
- Recurse: "*Flips through notes*", suspicious, investigative
- Human: Italic narration, asks questions

### 5. Creative Storytelling System
- 7 Episode types (rotate, don't repeat)
- Character arcs and relationships
- Meta-narrative layer (escape story)
- Visual language (scenes, not scripts)
- Teaching through story (not lectures)
- SEO through character obsessions

## HOW TO USE

### For Episode Generation:

1. **Read Required Files:**
   - `CURSOR_MASTER_GENERATION_PROMPT.md`
   - `lib/validation/banned-phrases.txt`
   - `lib/validation/style-guide.md`
   - `ARTIST_STORYTELLER_SYSTEM.md`

2. **Follow Workflow:**
   - Generate draft
   - Check banned phrases
   - Fact-check and cite sources
   - Verify character voices
   - Check structure/formatting
   - Run validation script
   - Creative validation
   - Final read-through

3. **Run Validation:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/validate-episode.sh content/blog/[filename].md
   ```

4. **Fix Issues:**
   - If ANY check fails, fix before saving
   - No "good enough" - must be perfect

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Storytelling, Not Content Generation**
   - Create scenes readers can visualize
   - Build character relationships
   - Teach through narrative

2. **Quality Over Speed**
   - No "good enough"
   - Perfect or don't save
   - User trusts us to ship quality

3. **Character-Driven SEO**
   - Keywords emerge from character obsessions
   - Natural integration, not force-fit
   - SEO through authenticity

4. **Entertainment + Education**
   - Must be enjoyable to read
   - Must actually teach concepts
   - Must stand out from other AI blogs
