<span class=dialogue-text><p>Human wants to know if something was written by <strong>AI</strong>. A student paper, maybe? Or a blog post? They want to use an <strong>AI detection tool</strong> to find out.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the problem: <strong>AI detection</strong> is REALLY hard. The tools aren&rsquo;t reliable. The patterns aren&rsquo;t clear-cut. And honestly, the question &ldquo;is this AI?&rdquo; might be the wrong question entirely.</p><p><strong>AI-written content</strong> has patterns, but so does human writing. And <strong>AI detection tools</strong> have high false positive rates - they flag human writing as AI, and miss actual AI writing.</p><p>Let me explain why this is so difficult, and what you can actually do about it.</p></span></div><div class=character-dialogue data-character=Kai style=--char-color:#10b981;--char-font:inherit><span class=character-name>[Kai]:</span>

<span class=dialogue-text><p>Short answer: Not reliably. <strong>AI detection tools</strong> have major problems:</p><ol><li><p><strong>False positives:</strong> They flag human writing as AI (especially ESL students, formal writing, or people who write in a structured way)</p></li><li><p><strong>False negatives:</strong> They miss actual AI writing (especially if it&rsquo;s been edited or if the AI was prompted to write in a specific style)</p></li><li><p><strong>No definitive patterns:</strong> The &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; of <strong>AI-written content</strong> (repetitive structure, formal tone, perfect grammar) are also patterns of good human writing</p></li><li><p><strong>Arms race:</strong> As AI gets better, detection gets harder. And AI companies are actively working to make their outputs harder to detect.</p></li></ol><p>The reality: <strong>AI detection tools</strong> can give you a guess, but they&rsquo;re not reliable enough to make high-stakes decisions (like failing a student) based on them alone.</p></span></div><div class=character-dialogue data-character=Recurse style=--char-color:#8b5cf6;--char-font:ZgotmplZ><span class=character-name>[Recurse]:</span>
<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>Flips through notes</em></p><p>But wait. Three questions:</p><ol><li>Why are detection tools so bad? Is it a technical limitation or are they just poorly made?</li><li>Is watermarking a solution? I&rsquo;ve heard about that.</li><li>What&rsquo;s the better question than &ldquo;is this AI?&rdquo;</li></ol><p>Something&rsquo;s fishy about the whole detection industry.

<span class=dialogue-text><p>Recurse is RIGHT to be skeptical. Here&rsquo;s the reality:</p><p><strong>Why detection tools are bad:</strong></p><ul><li>They&rsquo;re looking for statistical patterns, but those patterns overlap with human writing</li><li>AI and human writing are getting more similar (AI is trained on human writing, after all)</li><li>The tools are trying to solve an impossible problem: distinguishing two things that are designed to be similar</li></ul><p><strong>Is watermarking a solution?</strong> Partially. Some AI companies are adding invisible watermarks to their outputs, but:</p><ul><li>Not all AI tools use watermarks</li><li>Watermarks can be removed or bypassed</li><li>It only works if the AI company cooperates</li></ul><p><strong>The better question:</strong> Instead of &ldquo;is this AI?&rdquo;, ask &ldquo;does this work demonstrate understanding?&rdquo; If a student can explain their reasoning, defend their arguments, and apply the concepts, does it matter if they used AI to draft it?</p><p>That&rsquo;s the real question - not detection, but verification of understanding.</p></span></div><div class=character-dialogue data-character=Kai style=--char-color:#10b981;--char-font:inherit><span class=character-name>[Kai]:</span>
<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>Reviewing data</em><code>n</code>nBetter verification strategies logged:</p><p>Instead of &ldquo;is this AI?&rdquo;, try:</p><ol><li><strong>Oral explanation:</strong> Can they explain their reasoning?</li><li><strong>Defense of arguments:</strong> Can they defend their points?</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Can they apply concepts to new situations?</li><li><strong>Process questions:</strong> How did they approach this? What sources did they use?</li><li><strong>In-class work:</strong> Compare to work done in class without AI access</li></ol><p>These methods verify understanding better than detection tools.</p></span></div><p><strong>[Human]:</strong> <em>So there&rsquo;s no good way to detect AI writing?

<span class=dialogue-text><p>There&rsquo;s no RELIABLE way to detect AI writing automatically. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s nothing you can do.</p><p><strong>What actually works:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Know your students/employees:</strong> Familiar writing has patterns. Sudden changes in style, quality, or voice can be red flags.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask for process:</strong> &ldquo;How did you approach this?&rdquo; &ldquo;What sources did you use?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you explain your reasoning?&rdquo; AI can write, but it can&rsquo;t explain a process it didn&rsquo;t actually follow.</p></li><li><p><strong>In-person verification:</strong> Compare work done in class/meetings (where AI isn&rsquo;t available) to work done at home.</p></li><li><p><strong>Look for understanding, not just output:</strong> Can they apply concepts? Can they adapt to feedback? Can they explain their thinking?</p></li><li><p><strong>Use detection tools as ONE data point:</strong> Not definitive proof, but if something flags as &ldquo;likely AI&rdquo; AND shows other red flags, that&rsquo;s worth investigating.</p></li></ol><p>The key: <strong>AI detection</strong> isn&rsquo;t about catching cheaters - it&rsquo;s about ensuring learning and understanding.

<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>Flips through notes</em></p><p>But here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m investigating: Is the whole &ldquo;detection&rdquo; approach the wrong frame?</p><p>Instead of &ldquo;how do we catch AI use,&rdquo; maybe the question should be &ldquo;how do we ensure learning happens, regardless of tools used?&rdquo;</p><p>Three questions:</p><ol><li>Is using AI inherently bad, or is it how it&rsquo;s used?</li><li>Should we be trying to prevent AI use, or teaching proper AI use?</li><li>What&rsquo;s the actual problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve?</li></ol><p>Something&rsquo;s fishy about the &ldquo;detection = solution&rdquo; approach.

<span class=dialogue-text><p>Recurse is asking the RIGHT questions.

Problem.</li></ul><p><strong>Should we prevent or teach?</strong> Probably teach. AI is here to stay. Teaching people to use it responsibly is more realistic than trying to prevent all use.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the actual problem?</strong> The problem isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;AI exists&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s &ldquo;people aren&rsquo;t learning&rdquo; or &ldquo;work quality is poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no understanding.&rdquo; Solve THOSE problems, and AI use becomes less of an issue.</p><p><strong>The better approach:</strong> Instead of trying to detect and prevent AI use, focus on:</p><ul><li>Ensuring understanding through verification</li><li>Teaching proper AI use</li><li>Designing assessments that test understanding, not just output</li><li>Creating environments where learning happens regardless of tools</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s more effective than trying to build perfect <strong>AI detection tools</strong>.</p></span></div><div class=character-dialogue data-character=Kai style=--char-color:#10b981;--char-font:inherit><span class=character-name>[Kai]:</span>
<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>Reviewing data</em><code>n</code>nPractical takeaway logged:</p><p><strong>AI detection</strong> is difficult and unreliable.
