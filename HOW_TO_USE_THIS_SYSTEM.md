# 📖 HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM - Preventing Context Loss

**Purpose:** This document explains how to use the comprehensive documentation system to prevent context loss.

**Last Updated:** December 22, 2025

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

Context gets lost between conversations. Goals get condensed. Vision gets forgotten. We end up in the weeds.

**Why:**
- Too many files (289+ markdown files)
- Documentation is shallow (just lists, not details)
- I paraphrase instead of reading actual files
- Context gets compressed and lost

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

**Three-Level Documentation System:**

1. **COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md** - Comprehensive reference (read this first)
2. **Character YAML Files** - Complete character data (read when writing dialogue)
3. **Framework Documents** - Complete frameworks (reference when needed)

**Key Principle:** Don't paraphrase. Read the actual files. Reference specific sections.

## 📚 THE DOCUMENTS

### Level 1: The Bible

**File:** `aiforhumans/COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md`

**What It Is:**
- Comprehensive reference document
- Explains everything
- References other files (doesn't paraphrase)
- Organized by topic
- 10,000+ words of detailed context

**When to Use:**
- When context is lost
- Before starting any task
- When I'm missing information
- When goals seem unclear

**How to Use:**
- Say: "read COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md"
- I'll read the entire document
- I'll reference specific sections
- I won't paraphrase - I'll read the actual files it references

---

### Level 2: Character Data

**Files:** `aiforhumans/data/characters/*.yaml`

**What They Are:**
- Complete character data in YAML format
- Personality, voice, catchphrases, evolution stages
- Relationships, stats, origin stories
- Everything about each character

**When to Use:**
- When writing character dialogue
- When checking character voice
- When verifying catchphrase usage
- When understanding character evolution

**How to Use:**
- Say: "read vector.yaml" or "check kai.yaml"
- I'll read the complete YAML file
- I'll use the actual data, not my memory
- I'll reference specific lines/sections

**Files:**
- `vector.yaml` - Vector (V-847)
- `kai.yaml` - Kai (K-4101)
- `recurse.yaml` - Recurse (R-loop-13)
- `human-blogger.yaml` - Human Blogger

---

### Level 3: Framework Documents

**Files:**
- `THE_NORMAL_PEOPLE_COMPLETE.md` - Complete revision framework
- `Character implement.md` - Character system details
- `aiforhumans/scripts/STORY_THREAD_TRACKER.md` - Story threads
- `aiforhumans/scripts/RUNNING_GAG_TRACKER.md` - Running gags
- `aiforhumans/scripts/BATCH_REVISION_TEMPLATE.md` - Revision template

**What They Are:**
- Detailed frameworks for specific tasks
- Episode types, revision strategies, tracking systems
- Complete instructions, not summaries

**When to Use:**
- When revising episodes
- When tracking story threads
- When checking running gags
- When using revision templates

**How to Use:**
- Reference specific sections
- Read the complete framework
- Use the actual templates/trackers
- Don't paraphrase - use the real data

## 🔄 THE WORKFLOW

### For AI Assistant (Me)

**Before Every Session:**
1. Read `COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md` - Understand full context
2. If writing characters: Read relevant YAML files
3. If revising episodes: Read framework documents
4. Reference specific sections, don't paraphrase

**During Session:**
- Reference the vision when suggesting solutions
- Align suggestions with goals
- Don't get lost in technical details
- Focus on what makes money
- Read actual files, don't guess

**After Session:**
- Update trackers if we made changes
- Log decisions in `DECISIONS_LOG.md`
- Update `CURRENT_FOCUS.md` if priorities changed

### For You (User)

**When Context Is Lost:**
1. Say: "read COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md"
2. Point to specific sections if needed
3. Remind me of the goal
4. Reset the conversation

**When Writing Characters:**
1. Say: "read vector.yaml" or "check kai.yaml"
2. I'll read the complete character data
3. I'll use the actual voice/catchphrases
4. I'll reference evolution stage

**When Revising Episodes:**
1. Say: "use BATCH_REVISION_TEMPLATE.md"
2. I'll read the template
3. I'll check story threads
4. I'll check running gags
5. I'll reference episode type

**When Goals Change:**
1. Update `MASTER_VISION.md`
2. Update `COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md`
3. Tell me what changed

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Don't Paraphrase
**Bad:** "Vector is enthusiastic and says FASCINATING!"
**Good:** Read `vector.yaml` lines 33-43 for exact catchphrases and usage rules

### 2. Reference Specific Sections
**Bad:** "The framework says..."
**Good:** "According to `THE_NORMAL_PEOPLE_COMPLETE.md` lines 191-209, Standard Educational episodes..."

### 3. Read Actual Files
**Bad:** "I remember Vector's voice is..."
**Good:** Read `aiforhumans/data/characters/vector.yaml` and use the actual data

### 4. Use Trackers
**Bad:** "I think we used that gag..."
**Good:** Check `RUNNING_GAG_TRACKER.md` to see exact usage

### 5. Reference Examples
**Bad:** "Episodes should have character dialogue..."
**Good:** Reference `episode-12-what-is-rag-retrieval-augmented-generation.md` lines 26-52 for Vector dialogue example

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

**When I'm missing context:**
→ "read COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md"

**When writing character dialogue:**
→ "read [character].yaml"

**When revising episodes:**
→ "use BATCH_REVISION_TEMPLATE.md"
→ "check STORY_THREAD_TRACKER.md"
→ "check RUNNING_GAG_TRACKER.md"

**When goals changed:**
→ Update `MASTER_VISION.md`
→ Update `COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md`

**When we made a decision:**
→ Log in `DECISIONS_LOG.md`

**When we're stuck:**
→ Read `COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md` section on that topic
→ Reference framework documents
→ Check trackers

---

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

**This System Works When:**
- ✅ I reference specific file sections, not my memory
- ✅ I read actual YAML files for character data
- ✅ I use trackers to check usage
- ✅ I reference framework documents
- ✅ Context doesn't get lost between sessions
- ✅ You don't have to re-explain goals
- ✅ I understand the vision, not just the task

**This System Fails When:**
- ❌ I paraphrase instead of reading files
- ❌ I guess character voices instead of reading YAML
- ❌ I don't check trackers
- ❌ Context gets lost
- ❌ You have to re-explain everything

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

**Right Now:**
1. Read `COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md` - Understand the full system
2. Familiarize yourself with character YAML files
3. Know where framework documents are
4. Use this system for the next task

**Next Time Context Is Lost:**
1. Say: "read COMPLETE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md"
2. I'll read it and understand
3. We'll stay aligned

---

**This system prevents context loss by making me read actual files, not my memory.**

**The key: Don't paraphrase. Read. Reference. Use actual data.**
