## ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS

### Option 1: Use Instagram Basic Display API
**Easier to get approved:**
- Less strict requirements
- Still allows posting
- Might be easier to access

**Steps:**
1. Try accessing: https://developers.facebook.com
2. Look for "Instagram Basic Display" instead of "Graph API"
3. Might have different approval process

### Option 2: Use Third-Party Service
**Services that handle API for you:**
- **Buffer** - Social media management (has API)
- **Hootsuite** - Social media scheduling
- **Later** - Instagram scheduling
- **Zapier** - Automation (might have Instagram integration)

**Pros:**
- No Developer account needed
- Easier setup
- Handle API complexity

**Cons:**
- Monthly cost ($10-30/month)
- Less control
- Might have limitations

---

### Option 3: Manual Posting (For Now)
**Post manually while waiting:**
- Use Business Suite to schedule posts
- Or post directly from Instagram
- Add Instagram later when Developer access works

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- No setup needed
- Free

**Cons:**
- Not automated
- Have to remember to post
- Less efficient

### Option 4: Use Different Account
**If you have another Facebook account:**
- Use personal account (if allowed)
- Or use a different business account
- Create Developer account there

**Note:** Make sure it's allowed by Facebook's terms

## RECOMMENDATION

**Short-term:**
1. **Try to fix access:**
   - Verify account completely
   - Wait 24-48 hours
   - Try again

   - Or use a service like Buffer/Zapier
   - Focus on Bluesky (already working!)

**Long-term:**

- Then add Instagram automation

---

## WHAT TO DO NOW

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Keep using Bluesky (working!)
2. ✅ Post to Instagram manually (via Business Suite)

**Don't stress about it - Bluesky is working, and you can add Instagram later!**
