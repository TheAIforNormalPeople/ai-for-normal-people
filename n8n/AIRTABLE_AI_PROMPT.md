## CREATE AIRTABLE BASE FOR N8N AUTOMATION WORKFLOW

I need an Airtable base to track automated social media posts from my n8n workflow. The workflow automatically tweets when new blog episodes are published.

### BASE NAME:
"Automation Tracking"

### TABLE 1: "Posted Content"

This table tracks which blog posts have been automatically posted to social media platforms. The n8n workflow will read from and write to this table.

**Fields needed (exact names are critical for API integration):**

1. **URL** (Field Type: URL)
   - This stores the blog post URL (e.g., https://theaifornormalpeople.com/blog/episode-07-chatgpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini-comparison/)
   - Used to check if a post has already been shared
   - Required field

2. **Platform** (Field Type: Single select)
   - Options: Twitter (this workflow is Twitter-only)
   - Default: Twitter
   - This tracks which platform the content was posted to
   - Note: Currently only Twitter, but field allows for future expansion
   - Required field

3. **Posted Date** (Field Type: Date)
   - Include time: Yes
   - This records when the post was automatically published
   - Auto-populated by n8n workflow
   - Required field

4. **Tweet Text** (Field Type: Long text)
   - This stores the actual tweet/caption text that was posted
   - Generated by Claude AI via n8n
   - Can be long (up to 280 characters for Twitter, but store full text)
   - Optional field (for non-Twitter platforms, this might be empty)

5. **Tweet URL** (Field Type: URL)
   - This stores the URL of the posted tweet/social media post
   - Example: https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890
   - Used to track engagement later
   - Optional field

### IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AI BUILDER:

- Field names must match EXACTLY: "URL", "Platform", "Posted Date", "Tweet Text", "Tweet URL" (case-sensitive)
- The "URL" field is used in a filter formula: `URL = '{{$json["link"]}}'` - so it must be a URL field type
- The "Platform" field must be Single select with "Twitter" as the option (this workflow only posts to Twitter)
- The table name must be exactly "Posted Content" (with space, capital P and C)
- All fields should allow empty values except where noted as "Required"
- The base will be accessed via Airtable API from n8n automation tool
- This workflow is specifically for auto-tweeting blog posts, not other platforms

### WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

The n8n workflow will:
1. Read from this table to check if a URL already exists (prevents duplicate posts)
2. Append new records when posts are successfully published
3. Use the filter: `URL = '{{episode_url}}'` to check for existing records

### EXAMPLE RECORD:

- URL: https://theaifornormalpeople.com/blog/episode-07-chatgpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini-comparison/
- Platform: Twitter
- Posted Date: 2025-12-12 14:30:00
- Tweet Text: "FASCINATING comparison! ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini - which one should YOU actually use? Vector tested all three and found they're DIFFERENT, not better or worse! https://theaifornormalpeople.com/blog/episode-07-chatgpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini-comparison/"
- Tweet URL: https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890

**Please create this base with the exact table name and field names as specified. The field names are critical for API integration.**
