## QUALITY CHECK

Before generating Episode 19, verify:

- [ ] At least one character NOT doing a bit (variety)
- [ ] Any callbacks planted 3+ episodes ago that need attention?
- [ ] Running gags progressing appropriately?
- [ ] Meta humor used sparingly (not every episode)?
- [ ] Vector is meaner/intelligent, not just enthusiastic?
- [ ] No repetition of educational content (inventive explanations)?
