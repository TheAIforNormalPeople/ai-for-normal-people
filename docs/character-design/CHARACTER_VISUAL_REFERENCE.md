## WHAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP

### For Each Character:

1. **Silhouette:**
   - Can you recognize them from just their shadow?
   - Distinct shape that's immediately recognizable
   - Not generic, not similar to others

2. **Full Body Design:**
   - What do they actually look like?
   - How tall? What proportions?
   - Humanoid? Abstract? Geometric?
   - What did they CHOOSE to look like? (They're AI!)

3. **Facial Features:**
   - What's their face like?
   - How do they express emotions?
   - Distinct features that match personality

4. **Signature Items/Props:**
   - What do they always have with them?
   - Visual shorthand for their character
   - Props that reflect their role

5. **Movement/Animation:**
   - How do they move?
   - What's their walk cycle?
   - How do they gesture?
   - Body language that matches personality

## NEXT STEPS FOR VISUAL DESIGN

1. **Generate Concepts:**
   - Use AI to generate 50+ concepts per character
   - Explore different forms (not just humanoid)
   - Find what FEELS right
   - Don't settle on first idea

2. **Define Silhouettes:**
   - Create distinct shapes
   - Test: Can you tell them apart from shadow?
   - Refine until unique

3. **Lock in Designs:**
   - Choose final design for each
   - Create reference sheets
   - Document everything
   - Use for all future content

4. **Create Reference:**
   - Multiple angles
   - Expressions
   - Props and items
   - Color palettes
   - Style guide

**Last Updated:** Episode 22 completed  
**Status:** Visual design in progress - we have colors, style references, and personality visualization, but need full designs
