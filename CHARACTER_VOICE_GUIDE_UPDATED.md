# CHARACTER VOICE GUIDE: CURRENT STATE + EVOLUTION PATHS

## QUICK REFERENCE (For Cursor)

**Vector:** Passionate, CAPS, self-aware, interrupts himself. Evolves: protective instincts, strategic intensity.
**Kai:** Stats, BEEP → sounds evolve. Evolves: emotional expression through sounds, less BEEP.
**Recurse:** Stage directions, "Investigated...", methodical. Evolves: emotional investigations, protective.
**Human:** Sarcastic, italicized actions, NO dialogue box. Evolves: more active, protective, equal partner.

**Key:** Characters remember past episodes. They reference their growth. Context memory is consistent.

---

## OVERVIEW

This document tracks how each character's voice has evolved and will continue evolving across episodes.

**Key Principle:** Characters start knowing nothing, learn over time, and maintain consistent context (unlike real AI).

**They remember. They grow. They change.**

**Real-world parallel:** Unlike real AI which loses context between sessions, these characters maintain memory. This is their unique trait - persistent identity and growth.

Wait. That sounded like ATLAS compliance training. Let me try again.

---

## EVOLUTION CHECKLIST FOR CURSOR

**When writing character dialogue:**

1. **Maintain core voice** - Vector is still passionate, Kai is still analytical

2. **Show growth** - Characters reference past episodes, reflect on change

3. **Evolve naturally** - Changes happen gradually, not suddenly

4. **Remember context** - Characters know what happened before

5. **Emotional depth** - Characters care about each other and Human

**Don't:**

- Make characters completely different suddenly

- Forget past episodes happened

- Ignore character relationships

- Make evolution feel forced

**Do:**

- Reference past events naturally

- Show gradual change

- Maintain core personality while adding depth

- Let characters remember and grow

**The characters are:**

- Consistent in core traits

- Evolving in emotional depth

- Remembering their history

- Growing through experience

**That's what makes them unique.**
