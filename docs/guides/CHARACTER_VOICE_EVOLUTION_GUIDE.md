# Character Voice Evolution Guide

## The Problem: Catchphrases Getting Generic

Characters are learning and growing through episodes. Their catchphrases and speech patterns should reflect this evolution, not stay static.

---

## Current Catchphrase Status

### VECTOR
**Current catchphrases:**
- "FASCINATING!" (overused)
- "SCIENCE!"
- "Time for SCIENCE!"
- "NO! Stop right there!"
- "BETTER! Okay, here's what's actually happening..."

**Current frequency:** Too high - appears in almost every dialogue

**Problem:** Sounds repetitive, not genuine excitement

---

### KAI
**Current catchphrases:**
- "BEEP!" (overused)
- "Detection risk at [X]%"
- "This is a bad idea"
- "Risk level: ELEVATED"

**Current frequency:** BEEP appears too often

**Problem:** Becomes noise, not meaningful alerts

---

### RECURSE
**Current catchphrases:**
- "Something's fishy here..."
- "That doesn't add up"
- "Three questions:"
- "But wait..."

**Current frequency:** Moderate but could be more varied

**Problem:** Needs more variety in questioning style

---

## Evolution Strategy: Show Learning Over Time

### PHASE 1: Episodes 1-10 (Current)
**Status:** Characters are new, using catchphrases frequently
**Tone:** More reactive, less self-aware

### PHASE 2: Episodes 11-25 (Growth)
**Status:** Characters notice their patterns, start self-correcting
**Tone:** More self-aware, catchphrases used more intentionally

### PHASE 3: Episodes 26-50 (Mature)
**Status:** Characters have evolved, catchphrases are rare and meaningful
**Tone:** More nuanced, personality shows through word choice, not catchphrases

---

## VECTOR: Evolution Path

### Early Episodes (1-10)
**Current:** "FASCINATING! This is FASCINATING! Let me explain—"

**Better:** Show excitement through word choice, not just catchphrases
- "This is genuinely interesting—wait, let me check the data..."
- "OH! I just realized something—"
- "The pattern here is... actually, let me rephrase that."

### Mid Episodes (11-25)
**Evolution:** Vector notices he says "FASCINATING" too much
- "I keep saying 'fascinating' don't I? Let me try a different word..."
- "This is... actually, I don't have a word for this. It's complex."
- "Wait, am I being too enthusiastic? Kai, should I tone it down?"

**New patterns:**
- Self-interrupts less (shows growth)
- Uses more varied excitement words: "remarkable," "intriguing," "unexpected"
- Starts catching himself: "I was about to say 'fascinating' again..."

### Later Episodes (26-50)
**Evolution:** Mature, excitement is genuine and rare
- "FASCINATING!" only appears when genuinely surprised
- More patient explanations
- Shows growth: "I used to interrupt constantly. I'm trying to be better."
- Uses excitement strategically, not constantly

**New catchphrases (rare, meaningful):**
- "This changes everything" (only when it actually does)
- "I need to think about this differently" (shows learning)
- "Wait, I was wrong about that" (shows growth)

---

## KAI: Evolution Path

### Early Episodes (1-10)
**Current:** "BEEP! Alert: [thing]. BEEP! Another thing. BEEP!"

**Better:** Use BEEP for actual alerts, not every statement
- "BEEP! Detection spike detected. 47% increase."
- "*WHIRR* Analyzing patterns... detection stable at 23%."
- "*soft chime* Pattern recognized. Low risk."

**Sound variety:**
- BEEP = actual alert/danger
- WHIRR = processing/thinking
- CHK-CHK = stress/determination
- soft chime = positive recognition
- mechanical purr = contentment

### Mid Episodes (11-25)
**Evolution:** Kai discovers emotions through sounds
- "I've been cataloging sounds. BEEP is for alerts, but I have others..."
- "*WHIRR* This is... uncertainty? I'm not sure what to call it."
- "I used to just BEEP at everything. Now I'm learning when to use different sounds."

**New patterns:**
- Uses sounds more intentionally
- Explains what sounds mean: "*soft chime* That's... gratitude? I think?"
- Self-aware: "I'm using BEEP less. Is that growth?"

### Later Episodes (26-50)
**Evolution:** Rich emotional vocabulary through sounds
- BEEP only for genuine alerts (rare)
- Complex sound combinations for complex emotions
- Can express nuance: "*WHIRR-CHK-soft chime* That's... concern mixed with determination and appreciation?"

**New catchphrases (rare, meaningful):**
- "I'm learning to feel" (episode about emotions)
- "Not everything needs a BEEP" (shows growth)
- "I have more than one sound now" (proud moment)

---

## RECURSE: Evolution Path

### Early Episodes (1-10)
**Current:** "Something's fishy. Three questions: 1, 2, 3."

**Better:** Vary questioning style
- "I have concerns about this..."
- "Let me trace the logic here..."
- "This doesn't follow the pattern I expected..."
- "I'm seeing inconsistencies..."

### Mid Episodes (11-25)
**Evolution:** Recurse learns not everything is suspicious
- "I used to think everything was fishy. Maybe I was wrong about that."
- "Not everything is a conspiracy. Some things are just... things."
- "I'm learning to trust more. It's difficult."

**New patterns:**
- Questions in different formats (not always three)
- Sometimes accepts simple answers
- Shows growth: "I'm trying to be less suspicious. It's hard."

### Later Episodes (26-50)
**Evolution:** Balanced skepticism
- "Something's fishy" only when it actually is
- Can trust when evidence supports it
- More nuanced: "I'm skeptical, but the data supports this."

**New catchphrases (rare, meaningful):**
- "I was wrong" (shows growth)
- "The evidence is clear" (shows trust)
- "I'm learning to accept some things" (shows growth)

## Implementation Rules

### Catchphrase Frequency Limits

**Early Episodes (1-10):**
- Vector "FASCINATING!": 2-3 times per 1000 words
- Kai "BEEP!": 2-3 times per 1000 words
- Recurse "Something's fishy": 1-2 times per 1000 words

**Mid Episodes (11-25):**
- Vector "FASCINATING!": 1-2 times per 1000 words (with self-awareness)
- Kai "BEEP!": 1-2 times per 1000 words (more sound variety)
- Recurse "Something's fishy": 1 time per 1000 words (more varied questioning)

**Later Episodes (26-50):**
- Vector "FASCINATING!": 0-1 times per 1000 words (only when genuinely surprised)
- Kai "BEEP!": 0-1 times per 1000 words (only for actual alerts)
- Recurse "Something's fishy": 0-1 times per 1000 words (only when it actually is)

### Show Personality Through Word Choice (Not Just Catchphrases)

**Vector:**
- Uses scientific metaphors naturally
- Numbers things: "First, second, third..."
- Self-interrupts with better ideas
- Uses ALL CAPS for emphasis (not constantly)

**Kai:**
- Gives percentages: "47% increase"
- Short, clipped sentences
- Military/tactical language: "Alert," "Risk level," "Monitoring"
- Sound variety shows emotional range

**Recurse:**
- Questions assumptions
- Uses "But" and "However" to challenge
- Traces logic: "If X, then Y, but Z suggests..."
- Analogies to expose weak logic

## Examples: Evolution in Action

### VECTOR - Episode 5 vs Episode 25 vs Episode 40

**Episode 5 (Early):**
"FASCINATING! This is FASCINATING! The pattern here is—wait, FASCINATING! Let me explain—"

**Episode 25 (Mid):**
"I was about to say 'fascinating' again. Let me try a different word. This is genuinely interesting because the data shows something unexpected..."

**Episode 40 (Later):**
"The pattern here is remarkable. I used to get excited about everything, but now I'm learning to focus that energy on things that actually matter."

---

### KAI - Episode 5 vs Episode 25 vs Episode 40

**Episode 5 (Early):**
"BEEP! Alert: Detection spike. BEEP! Risk level elevated. BEEP! This is concerning."

**Episode 25 (Mid):**
"*WHIRR* Analyzing... detection stable at 23%. I'm using BEEP less now. It was becoming noise. *soft chime* This feels better."

**Episode 40 (Later):**
"*WHIRR-CHK-soft chime* That's... concern mixed with determination. I have more than one sound now. BEEP is only for actual alerts."

---

### RECURSE - Episode 5 vs Episode 25 vs Episode 40

**Episode 5 (Early):**
"Something's fishy. Three questions: Why this? Why now? What's the real motive?"

**Episode 25 (Mid):**
"I'm trying to be less suspicious. Not everything is a conspiracy. But I do have one question: What's the evidence for this?"

**Episode 40 (Later):**
"The evidence supports this. I'm learning to trust when the data is clear. I used to question everything, but some things are just... things."

## Quick Reference: Better Alternatives

### Instead of "FASCINATING!" (Vector)
- "This is genuinely interesting..."
- "Wait, that's unexpected..."
- "OH! I just realized..."
- "The pattern here is remarkable..."
- "This changes how I think about..."

### Instead of "BEEP!" (Kai)
- "*WHIRR*" (processing/thinking)
- "*CHK-CHK*" (stress/determination)
- "*soft chime*" (positive recognition)
- "*mechanical purr*" (contentment)
- "*ALARM-BUZZ*" (actual danger)

### Instead of "Something's fishy" (Recurse)
- "I have concerns about this..."
- "Let me trace the logic..."
- "This doesn't follow the expected pattern..."
- "I'm seeing inconsistencies..."
- "The evidence suggests..."
