**[Human]:** *Can I use ChatGPT to fact-check things? I keep seeing people say "just ask AI" but also... it hallucinates?*

*I read something online and I'm not sure if it's true. I thought I could just ask ChatGPT to verify it, but then I remembered that ChatGPT sometimes makes things up. So can I use AI to fact-check AI? That seems like a—*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Flips through case files*

Oh, this is FASCINATING. Let me show you what happens when people use AI to fact-check AI...

*Pulls up investigation dashboard*

Case study: User asks ChatGPT to verify a claim. ChatGPT confirms it (incorrectly). User asks Claude to verify same claim. Claude also confirms it (incorrectly). Both AIs are wrong, but both sound confident.

Something's VERY fishy about using AI to verify AI.

*Analyzing patterns*`n`nPattern detection: User searches "AI fact checking" include terms: verify with AI, ChatGPT fact check.

Alert: AI fact-checking accuracy analysis:
- Direct fact verification: 45-60% accuracy (unreliable)
- Source finding: 72% accuracy (better)
- Logical inconsistency detection: 68% accuracy (moderate)

Problem: AI can't distinguish truth from plausibility.
{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So what's the actual workflow for checking if something's true?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
EXCELLENT question! Here's what AI IS good at vs. what it SUCKS at:

**What AI IS good at:**
- Finding sources and references (can search and summarize)
- Identifying logical inconsistencies (can spot contradictions)
- Summarizing claims (can break down complex arguments)
- Suggesting what to verify (can identify checkable claims)

**What AI SUCKS at:**
- Verifying facts directly (hallucination risk!)
- Determining truth vs. plausibility (can't distinguish)
- Checking recent information (training data cutoff)
- Verifying specific numbers or dates (often wrong)

**The paradox:** Using AI to fact-check AI just compounds the problem. If one AI is wrong, asking another AI doesn't help - they might both be wrong in the same way!

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Flips through notes*

But wait. Three questions:

1. Why can't AI verify facts if it "knows" so much?
2. What about using AI to find sources - is that reliable?
3. Is there ANY way to use AI for fact-checking that actually works?

Something's fishy about the entire premise. If AI can't verify truth, what CAN it do?
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
Recurse is asking the RIGHT questions! Here's why AI can't verify facts:

**The fundamental problem:**
- AI doesn't "know" facts - it knows patterns
- It generates plausible text, not verified information
- It has no concept of "true" vs. "false" - only "probable" vs. "improbable"
- It can't access real-time information (training data cutoff)

**What AI CAN do:**
- Find sources that MIGHT verify the claim (you still need to check the sources)
- Identify if a claim is logically consistent (but not if it's factually true)
- Suggest what to verify (but not verify it for you)
- Summarize what different sources say (but not determine which is correct)

**The better approach:**
1. AI finds sources and summarizes claims
2. YOU verify the sources (check if they're real, credible, recent)
3. YOU determine truth (compare sources, check primary sources)
4. AI helps organize your findings (but you make the judgment)

AI is a RESEARCH ASSISTANT for fact-checking, not a FACT-CHECKER itself!

*Reviewing data*`n`nFact-checking workflow logged:

**Effective workflow:**
1. AI finds potential sources (72% accuracy)
2. Human verifies sources are real and credible
3. Human checks primary sources directly
4. Human compares multiple sources
5. Human makes final determination

**Ineffective workflow:**
1. Ask AI "is this true?" (45-60% accuracy)
2. Accept AI's answer (high error rate)
3. Use AI to verify AI (compounds errors)

Alert: Always verify AI-provided sources. AI can make up sources that sound real.

**[Human]:** *So I should use AI to find sources, but I still need to verify those sources myself?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
EXACTLY! Use AI to HELP you fact-check, not to fact-check FOR you!

**The workflow:**
1. **AI finds sources:** "What sources discuss [claim]?" - AI suggests articles, papers, websites
2. **YOU verify sources:** Check if sources are real, credible, recent, primary
3. **YOU check primary sources:** Go to original sources, not summaries
4. **YOU compare:** Look at multiple sources, see if they agree
5. **YOU determine truth:** Make judgment based on verified sources

**Red flags when AI fact-checks:**
- AI gives "facts" without sources
- AI cites sources you can't verify
- AI sounds confident but can't show evidence
- AI contradicts itself when asked differently

**The key:** AI is a starting point for research, not the endpoint for verification. You still need to do the actual fact-checking yourself!

FASCINATING how people think AI can replace verification when it can't even distinguish truth from plausibility, right?

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Flips through notes*

But here's what I'm investigating: Is there ANY scenario where AI fact-checking is reliable?

What about:
- Checking if a claim is logically consistent?
- Finding if multiple sources agree?
- Identifying obvious falsehoods?

Something's fishy about saying "AI can't fact-check" when it can do SOME verification tasks.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
Recurse is RIGHT - AI CAN help with SOME fact-checking tasks!

**What AI CAN reliably do:**
- **Logical consistency:** "Does this claim contradict itself?" - AI is good at spotting contradictions
- **Source aggregation:** "What do different sources say about this?" - AI can summarize multiple perspectives
- **Obvious falsehoods:** "Is this obviously wrong?" - AI can catch clearly incorrect information (if it's in training data)

**What AI CAN'T reliably do:**
- Verify specific facts (hallucination risk)
- Check recent information (training cutoff)
- Determine which source is correct (no truth detector)
- Verify numbers or statistics (often wrong)

**The distinction:** AI can help you FIND information to verify, and can help you ORGANIZE that information, but YOU need to VERIFY it and JUDGE it.

So yes, AI can help with fact-checking - but as a research tool, not as a verification tool!

*Reviewing data*`n`nPractical takeaway logged:

**Use AI for fact-checking:**
- Finding potential sources
- Summarizing claims
- Identifying logical inconsistencies
- Organizing information

**Do yourself:**
- Verify sources are real and credible
- Check primary sources directly
- Compare multiple sources
- Make final truth determination

**Red flags:**
- AI gives facts without sources
- AI cites unverifiable sources
- AI sounds confident but shows no evidence

Detection risk: Low. General fact-checking advice.

**[Human]:** *Okay, so AI helps me find and organize information, but I still need to verify everything myself. That makes sense.*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
EXACTLY! AI is a RESEARCH ASSISTANT for fact-checking, not a FACT-CHECKER itself.

Use AI to find sources, summarize claims, and organize information. But YOU verify the sources, check primary sources, and determine truth.

The people who get fact-checking wrong are the ones who ask AI "is this true?" and accept the answer. The people who get it right are the ones who use AI to find information, then verify it themselves.

FASCINATING how the tool is the same, but the approach makes all the difference, right?
