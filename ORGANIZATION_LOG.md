## EXECUTION LOG

### 2026-01-03 - Starting Organization

**Files Reviewed:** 454+ markdown files across entire workspace

**Structure Identified:**
- Root level: Mixed files (some should be in aiforhumans)
- aiforhumans/: Main project folder with many root-level .md files
- docs/: Contains duplicates (_1.md files)
- n8n/: 103+ markdown files (mostly debug/troubleshooting)
- archive/: Already organized

**Issues Found:**
1. Duplicate `_1.md` files in `aiforhumans/docs/`
2. Many root-level markdown files in `aiforhumans/` that should be organized
3. n8n folder has too many debug files
4. Character visual design files scattered in root
5. Episode-related files scattered in root
6. Planning documents scattered in root
