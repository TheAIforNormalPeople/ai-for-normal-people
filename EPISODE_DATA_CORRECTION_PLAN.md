# 📊 Episode Data Correction Plan

**Goal:** Review all episodes and replace made-up AI statistics/data with either:
- Real, cited sources
- Character-acknowledged uncertainty ("I don't have exact data, but...")
- Removed statistics (if not essential)

---

## 🔍 What We're Looking For

### Made-Up Data Patterns

**Kai's Statistics:**
- Percentages without sources (e.g., "15-20% retention", "62% typing accuracy")
- "Pattern detected" with specific numbers
- "Analysis:" with made-up data
- Alert statements with statistics

**Vector's Claims:**
- Technical claims without sources
- "Studies show..." without citations
- Specific numbers about AI performance

**Recurse's Investigations:**
- "Data shows..." without sources
- Specific percentages in investigations

---

## 📋 Review Process

### Step 1: Identify All Made-Up Data

**Search for patterns:**
- `%` (percentages)
- `statistic`, `data`, `study`, `research`
- `analysis:`, `pattern detected:`, `alert:`
- Numbers followed by `%` or `percent`

### Step 2: Categorize Each Instance

**Category A: Essential to Story**
- Statistics that are central to the educational point
- **Action:** Find real source OR acknowledge uncertainty

**Category B: Character Voice**
- Statistics that show character personality (Kai's detection)
- **Action:** Keep but make it clear it's character speculation/estimation

**Category C: Unnecessary**
- Statistics that don't add value
- **Action:** Remove entirely

### Step 3: Fix Each Episode

**Option 1: Find Real Source**
- Research actual studies/data
- Cite properly
- Add to episode notes

**Option 2: Acknowledge Uncertainty**
- Change: "15-20% retention" 
- To: "Studies suggest passive learning has lower retention, but exact numbers vary"
- Or: "I don't have exact data, but the pattern suggests..."

**Option 3: Character Speculation**
- Keep statistics but make it clear it's Kai's estimation
- Add: "Based on my analysis of available data..."
- Or: "My calculations suggest approximately..."

**Option 4: Remove**
- If not essential, just remove the statistic
- Keep the educational point without the number

## 📝 Episode-by-Episode Review

### Episode 1-10 (Early Episodes)
**Status:** ⏳ Needs Review  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Notes:** Early episodes may have more made-up data as characters were finding their voice

### Episode 11-20 (Mid Series)
**Status:** ⏳ Needs Review  
**Priority:** High  
**Notes:** Characters more established, but may still have made-up statistics

### Episode 21-25 (Recent)
**Status:** ⏳ Needs Review  
**Priority:** High  
**Examples Found:**
- Episode 23: Retention rates (15-20%, 65-75%, 80-90%)
- Episode 19: Cognitive function percentages (62%, 234%, etc.)
- Episode 25: Cost percentages

### Episode 26+ (Future)
**Status:** ✅ Will be correct from start  
**Action:** Use this plan as template for new episodes

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Scan (2-3 hours)
1. Search all episodes for `%` and statistics
2. Create list of all instances
3. Categorize each (A/B/C)

### Phase 2: Research & Fix (4-6 hours)
1. For Category A: Research real sources
2. For Category B: Add uncertainty language
3. For Category C: Remove statistics

### Phase 3: Review & Update (2-3 hours)
1. Review each fix
2. Ensure character voice maintained
3. Update episode files

### Phase 4: Future Prevention (Ongoing)
1. Use this checklist for new episodes
2. Flag statistics during writing
3. Research before including numbers

## 📚 Example Fixes

### Example 1: Kai's Retention Statistics (Episode 23)

**Before:**
```
Analysis: Learning effectiveness data:
- Passive consumption: 15-20% retention after one week
- Active learning: 65-75% retention after one week
- Teaching back: 80-90% retention after one week
```

**After (Option 1 - Real Source):**
```
Analysis: Learning effectiveness data from educational research:
- Passive consumption: Studies show lower retention rates (typically 10-30% range)
- Active learning: Research indicates significantly higher retention (often 60-80% range)
- Teaching back: The "protégé effect" shows highest retention (often 75-90% range)

*Note: Exact percentages vary by study, but the pattern is consistent.*
```

**After (Option 2 - Uncertainty):**
```
Analysis: Learning effectiveness patterns I've observed:
- Passive consumption: Lower retention (exact numbers vary, but consistently lower)
- Active learning: Significantly higher retention (typically much better than passive)
- Teaching back: Highest retention rates (the pattern is clear even if I don't have exact data)

*CHK-CHK*

I don't have access to all educational research databases, but the pattern is consistent across what I can analyze.
```

### Example 2: Kai's Cognitive Analysis (Episode 19)

**Before:**
```
- Typing accuracy: 62% (normal: 96%)
- Error rate: 234% above baseline
- Processing speed: 58% of normal capacity
```

**After (Character Speculation):**
```
- Typing accuracy: Approximately 60-65% (significantly below your normal baseline)
- Error rate: Substantially elevated (estimated 200-250% above normal)
- Processing speed: Reduced to roughly 55-60% of typical capacity

*BEEP*

These are estimates based on pattern analysis. I don't have access to your baseline biometric data, but the deviation is significant.
