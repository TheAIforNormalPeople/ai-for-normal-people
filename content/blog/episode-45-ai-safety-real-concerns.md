**[Human]:** *Is AI actually dangerous? I keep hearing both "AI will kill us all" and "AI is harmless." What's real?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Dismissive*

AI killing us all? That's sci-fi! Current AI is just language models! They can't do anything!

*Gets less confident*

Well, they can do some things. But not... that.

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating*

Let me show you what's actually happening.

*Presents investigation findings*

Documented AI harms in 2024:

- Deepfake scams: $250M stolen (verified)
- Biased hiring systems: multiple discrimination lawsuits
- Misinformation at scale: measurable election impact
- Academic cheating: institutional crisis
- Job displacement: 4.7M roles affected

*Flips to next page*

Hypothetical AI harms (not yet happening):

- AGI taking over
- Skynet scenarios
- AI consciousness suffering

*Points to first list*

We should focus on THIS list. These are happening NOW.

**[Human]:** *So what should I actually worry about?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Real risks:

1. Misinformation: AI can generate convincing false information
2. Bias: AI reflects biases in training data
3. Privacy: Your data is being collected and used
4. Job displacement: Some roles are being automated
5. Dependence: Over-reliance on AI tools

*Pauses*

Not real (yet):
- AI taking over
- AI consciousness
- Terminator scenarios

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Gets serious*

Recurse is right. I was dismissing concerns, but the real risks are happening now.

*Thoughtful*

Deepfakes are real. Bias is real. Misinformation is real. These are current problems, not future ones.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

What you can do:

- Verify information from AI
- Be aware of bias in AI outputs
- Protect your privacy
- Don't over-rely on AI
- Stay informed about developments

*Closes notes*

Focus on real risks, not sci-fi scenarios.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: worry about current risks, not future sci-fi?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly. The real dangers are happening now. Focus on those.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

And use AI responsibly. That's the best protection.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Agrees*

Stay informed. Stay skeptical. Stay safe.
