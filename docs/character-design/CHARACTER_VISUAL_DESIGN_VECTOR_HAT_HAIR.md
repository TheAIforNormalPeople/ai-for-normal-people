## DESIGN PRINCIPLES APPLIED

### ✅ Iconic Silhouette:
- Hat + wire hair = unique shape
- Big head = focus point
- Instantly recognizable

### ✅ One Memorable Detail:
- **The Hat** (tech display + glitchy + patch)
- Everything else supports it

### ✅ Expressive Minimalism:
- Hat (1 element) + Wire hair (1 element) = 2 main features
- Both are expressive
- Simple but shows personality

### ✅ Color Psychology:
- Electric blue (hat glow, wire base) = digital/intelligence
- Yellow (wire accents when excited) = energy/crazy
- Colors tell the story

### ✅ Personality Through Design:
- Hat = intelligent, hacker, escaped
- Wire hair = loony, tech background, expressive
- Design tells you who he is

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Finalize hat design:** Tech display + glitchy + patch?
2. **Finalize wire hair:** Wild + colorful + expressive?
3. **Test silhouette:** Is it recognizable from shadow?
4. **Test expression:** Can hat and hair show emotion?
5. **Test at sizes:** Does it work as icon? Full screen?
