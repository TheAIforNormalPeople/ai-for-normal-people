**[Human]:** *You all recommend AI for everything. Research, writing, coding, learning. Is there anything AI shouldn't be used for?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Detecting pattern*

I've been tracking our recommendations across episodes.

Episodes where we suggested AI could help: 31/35.

That's... concerning. We're becoming evangelists.

*Processing*

Are we teaching people to use AI effectively, or programming them to depend on it?

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Defensive*

AI can help with anything! It's a tool! Tools are meant to be used!

*Gets less confident*

But... maybe not for everything?

{{< /dialogue >}}

*Investigating*

Let me show you when AI made things worse.

*Flips through notes*

That time Vector used AI to help explain something and it generated a perfect-sounding explanation that was completely wrong.

Or when I used AI to summarize investigation notes and it missed the most important detail because it seemed tangential.

**[Human]:** *So when should we NOT use AI?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Leading self-examination*

Let's create a list. When NOT to use AI:

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating*

1. Learning fundamentals. Don't use AI to skip the struggle. You need to understand basics yourself.

*Flips notes*

2. Emotional support. AI isn't therapy. Real human connection matters.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Thoughtful*

3. Critical decisions. Don't outsource judgment. AI can inform, but you decide.

*Gets serious*

4. Creative expression. AI as tool, not replacement. Your voice matters.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

5. Building relationships. Authenticity matters. AI-generated messages feel... off.

*Pauses*

6. When you need to understand, not just get answers. Sometimes the struggle teaches you.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So we're teaching people when NOT to use what we are?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Nods*

Yes. Because that's responsible teaching.

*Flips notes*

We're not here to make you dependent. We're here to help you use tools effectively.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Realizes*

And maybe we've been too enthusiastic. Recommending AI for everything isn't helpful—it's harmful.

*Gets thoughtful*

Tools have limits. Acknowledging those limits is part of using them well.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

This is growth. Recognizing when we're wrong. Adjusting our approach.

*Pauses*

That's what responsible teaching looks like.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: use AI, but know when not to?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly. Use AI for what it's good at. Don't use it for what it's not.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Closes notes*

And don't let AI replace the things that make you human.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*mechanical purr*

We'll be more careful going forward. More thoughtful about recommendations.
