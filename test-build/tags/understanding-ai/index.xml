      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI feels scary, right? You&amp;rsquo;re not alone in that. Many folks think it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of super-intelligent overlord just waiting to take over. It&amp;rsquo;s a common belief, and honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s fueled by sensationalism. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: AI is just a tool. Like any tool, it reflects the intentions of its users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to consider this: AI can analyze data and automate tasks, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t think or feel. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have desires. It&amp;rsquo;s not out to get you. What&amp;rsquo;s really intimidating is how it&amp;rsquo;s marketed. Companies push the narrative that AI will replace jobs and make us obsolete. But that&amp;rsquo;s a distraction. The real issue lies in how we use AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
