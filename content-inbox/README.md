# Content Inbox

Drop your content files here for blog post creation!

## How to Use This Folder

1. **Drop your content files here** - Any format works:
   - `.txt` files with blog content
   - `.md` markdown files
   - `.docx` Word documents (copy/paste the text)
   - Any text file with your content

2. **Name your files descriptively** (optional but helpful):
   - `chatgpt-tips.txt`
   - `ai-tools-review.md`
   - `blog-draft-productivity.txt`

3. **Tell me which file to process**, and I'll:
   - Read the content
   - Create a properly formatted Hugo blog post
   - Add SEO-optimized front matter
   - Structure it with headers and formatting
   - Save it to `content/blog/`

## What to Include in Your Content Files

You can give me:
- Just raw content (I'll structure it)
- SEO intro + FAQ sections (like you just did)
- Rough drafts (I'll polish them)
- Bullet points or outlines (I'll expand them)
- Keywords and topics (I'll write the whole thing)

## File Formats That Work

- ✅ `.txt` - Plain text
- ✅ `.md` - Markdown
- ✅ Copy/paste into a text file
- ✅ Content pasted directly in chat

## Example Workflow

```
1. You: Save your blog content as content-inbox/my-topic.txt
2. You: "Create a blog post from content-inbox/my-topic.txt"
3. Me: I'll read it and create a full Hugo blog post
4. Done! Post appears on your site
```

**Pro tip:** You can also just paste content directly in the chat! Whatever works best for your workflow.
