I&rsquo;ve been doing this.</p></span></div><p><strong>[Human]:</strong> <em>Okay, so here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned:</em></p><p><strong>The problem isn&rsquo;t the AI - it&rsquo;s using AI for the wrong parts of writing.</strong></p><p>Most people use AI to write the content. But AI is terrible at voice, perspective, and originality. AI is GOOD at:</p><ul><li>Research and fact-gathering</li><li>Creating outlines and structure</li><li>First drafts of technical sections</li><li>Editing for clarity and grammar</li></ul><p><strong>The workflow that actually works:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Research phase:</strong> I use AI to find sources, summarize information, suggest angles. But I verify everything. AI finds the info, I decide what matters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Planning phase:</strong> AI helps me outline. I refine the structure. AI suggests organization, I decide what flows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing phase:</strong> I write the actual content. In my voice. With my examples. My perspective. This is where AI can&rsquo;t help - this is where I have to do the work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Editing phase:</strong> AI helps catch errors, improve clarity, suggest alternatives. But I&rsquo;m editing MY words, not trying to fix generic AI voice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Polish phase:</strong> I add final touches, ensure voice is consistent. Make sure it sounds like me, not like AI.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The key insight:</strong> Use AI for information and structure. Do the creative work yourself.</p><p><em>leans back, satisfied</em></p><p>See? I can teach too! This is actually really satisfying. No wonder you do this all the time, Vector.</p><p><em>big smile, basking in the moment</em></p><p>HANG ON! HANG ON! Let me bask in this glory for a second. This is NICE!

Let me think&mldr;</em></p><p><strong>Can you teach AI your voice?</strong> Sort of. You can show it examples, describe your voice, and it&rsquo;ll get closer. But it&rsquo;ll never be perfect. You still need to edit. Think of it as &ldquo;AI writes a draft in your style&rdquo; not &ldquo;AI writes in your voice.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What if you don&rsquo;t have a strong voice yet?</strong> This is the tricky part. Using AI too early can actually prevent you from developing your voice. My advice: Write some things completely yourself first. Get comfortable with your own voice. THEN use AI to help with research and editing. Don&rsquo;t use AI to write until you know what YOUR writing sounds like.</p><p><strong>Better prompts?</strong> Yes! Instead of &ldquo;write an article about X,&rdquo; try:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Help me brainstorm angles for an article about X&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Create an outline for an article about X, focusing on [your perspective]&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Research X and summarize key points I should cover&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Edit this draft for clarity: [your writing]&rdquo;</li></ul><p>See the difference?
