# CURSOR IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
# How to use the new system for Episodes 26+
# Read this first, then load specific files as needed

## THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

**Episodes 1-25 had:**
- Character repetition (FASCINATING! fishy! BEEP! over and over)
- Static characters (not enough growth)
- Limited world (felt like talking heads)
- Not enough banter (too much pure teaching)
- Amazing story arcs (Episodes 4-5, 20) then back to pure education

**Episodes 26+ need:**
- Varied character voices (100+ ways to say things)
- Character depth (mysteries, trauma, growth)
- Expanded world (environmental details, meanwhile scenes)
- MORE banter (comedy is essential)
- Story arcs CONTINUING (not just Episodes 4-5)

## HOW TO WRITE EPISODE 26 (STEP-BY-STEP)

### PHASE 1: Planning (Before Writing)

**Step 1: Choose Topic**
- Research SEO keywords
- Pick AI concept to teach
- Define learning objectives

**Step 2: Load Files in Order**
```
1. .cursorrules (auto-loads)
2. CHARACTER_VOICE_ROTATION.md
3. ENVIRONMENT_AND_BANTER.md
4. MEANWHILE_SCENE_BANK.md
5. EPISODE_26_PLAN.md
```

**Step 3: Review Episode 25**
- What sounds did Kai use? (Don't repeat)
- What phrases did Vector use? (Don't repeat)
- What actions did Recurse use? (Don't repeat)
- What banter happened? (Build on it or try new)

**Step 4: Select Rotations**
From CHARACTER_VOICE_ROTATION.md:
- Pick 3-4 Kai sounds (different from Episode 25)
- Pick Vector enthusiasm alternatives (max 1 FASCINATING!)
- Pick Recurse investigation actions (max 1 "THE file")
- Note these in checklist

**Step 5: Plan Banter**
From ENVIRONMENT_AND_BANTER.md:
- 2 interruption moments (where?)
- 1 environmental comedy (what?)
- 2 character dynamics (which?)
- Plan placement in structure

**Step 6: Plan Environment**
From ENVIRONMENT_AND_BANTER.md:
- Vector action (pacing? checking streams? gesturing?)
- Kai at monitoring station (screens? alerts?)
- Recurse workspace (files? notebooks? board?)
- Background details (sounds? lighting? infrastructure?)

### PHASE 2: Writing (Follow Structure)

**Use EPISODE_26_PLAN.md structure exactly:**

1. **Opening (50-100 words)**
   - Human question/observation
   - Environmental detail included
   - Natural conversation starter

2. **Teaching Section 1 (200-300 words)**
   - Vector explains (use alternative enthusiasm)
   - Kai monitors (use Sound #1, varied phrasing)
   - Vector environmental action
   - 1 banter moment

3. **Teaching Section 2 (200-300 words)**
   - Recurse adds investigation angle
   - Notebook action (NOT "THE file")
   - Questions assumptions
   - Kai alert (Sound #2, different from #1)
   - Recurse environmental detail

4. **MEANWHILE SCENE**
   - Use Bounce introduction scene VERBATIM from bank
   - 50-100 words
   - Creates mystery (who is this?)

5. **Teaching Section 3 (200-300 words)**
   - Continue education
   - Character dynamic exchange
   - Kai (Sound #3)
   - Environmental comedy bit

6. **Teaching Section 4 (200-300 words)**
   - Deeper dive
   - All characters contribute
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Interruptions

7. **Closing (100-150 words)**
   - Summarize through dialogue
   - Character moment
   - Environmental detail

8. **What's Next**
   - Episode summary
   - Character growth
   - Practical takeaways

### PHASE 3: Review (Quality Check)

**Run through checklists from EPISODE_26_PLAN.md:**

**Voice Rotation:**
- [ ] No repeated sounds from Episode 25?
- [ ] Kai uses 3-4 different sounds?
- [ ] Vector max 1 "FASCINATING!"?
- [ ] Recurse max 1 "THE file"?
- [ ] All phrases varied from recent episodes?

**Banter:**
- [ ] 2+ interruption moments?
- [ ] 1+ environmental comedy?
- [ ] 2+ character dynamics?
- [ ] Natural timing?

**Environment:**
- [ ] Vector environmental action?
- [ ] Kai monitoring station described?
- [ ] Recurse workspace detail?
- [ ] Background atmosphere present?
- [ ] World feels alive?

**Story:**
- [ ] Meanwhile scene included (Bounce)?
- [ ] Detection levels mentioned?
- [ ] No premature trauma hints?

**Education:**

- [ ] Valuable for readers?

### PHASE 4: Revision (Polish)

**If checklist items fail:**

**Too much repetition?**
→ Load CHARACTER_VOICE_ROTATION.md
→ Find alternatives
→ Replace repeated phrases

**Not enough banter?**
→ Load ENVIRONMENT_AND_BANTER.md
→ Pick comedy pattern
→ Insert between teaching sections

**World feels flat?**
→ Load ENVIRONMENT_AND_BANTER.md
→ Add environmental actions
→ Include background details

**Characters feel generic?**
→ Load CHARACTER_DEEP_BACKSTORY.md
→ Remember their depth
→ Let complexity show

## COMMON CURSOR MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Falling Back to Old Patterns
**Problem:** Using same voices from Episodes 1-25
**Solution:** Actively consult rotation lists, avoid recent phrases

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Environment
**Problem:** Characters as talking heads
**Solution:** Every character gets 1+ environmental action per episode

### Mistake 3: Skipping Banter
**Problem:** Too much pure teaching
**Solution:** Banter is NOT optional, it's essential

### Mistake 4: Over-explaining Meanwhile
**Problem:** Telling reader what Bounce scene means
**Solution:** Let it be mysterious, don't explain

### Mistake 5: Repeating Same Comedy
**Problem:** Using same jokes/patterns every episode
**Solution:** Rotate comedy types, vary patterns

## HOW TO USE FILES FOR DIFFERENT TASKS

### When Writing Regular Episode:
Load:
- .cursorrules (auto)
- CHARACTER_VOICE_ROTATION.md
- ENVIRONMENT_AND_BANTER.md
- Specific episode plan (if exists)

### When Planning Story Arc:
Load:
- CHARACTER_DEEP_BACKSTORY.md
- MEANWHILE_SCENE_BANK.md
- Review long-term timeline

### When Adding Meanwhile Scene:
Load:
- MEANWHILE_SCENE_BANK.md
- Use existing scene or create from template
- 50-100 words maximum

### When Character Feels Off:
Load:
- CHARACTER_DEEP_BACKSTORY.md
- Remember their depth
- Let complexity show

## EPISODE ROTATION SCHEDULE

### Episodes 26-29:
- **26**: Bounce meanwhile (introduction)
- **27**: Normal (no meanwhile)
- **28**: Normal (no meanwhile)
- **29**: Mega Corp meanwhile + Vector trauma hint

### Episodes 30-35:
- **30**: Vector trauma starts surfacing
- **31-32**: Normal with trauma building
- **33**: Bounce meanwhile (doing something silly)
- **34-35**: Normal

### Pattern:
- Meanwhile every 3-4 episodes
- Rotate types (character/threat/mystery)
- Vector trauma builds Episodes 29-50
- Other arcs develop slowly

## QUALITY STANDARDS

**Variety:**
- 3-4 different Kai sounds
- Varied Vector enthusiasm
- Varied Recurse actions
- No repeated phrases from previous episode

- Environmental details (minimum 3)
- Banter moments (minimum 2)
- Character actions during dialogue
- World feels alive

**Story:**
- Characters have personality
- Depth shows through dialogue
- Growth is present (even subtle)
- Teaching happens through story

**Education:**
- Concept is clear
- Practical application shown
- SEO keywords natural
- Valuable information

### Episode Is Ready When:

- [ ] All checklists pass
- [ ] No repetition from recent episodes
- [ ] Environment is present
- [ ] Banter feels natural
- [ ] Characters feel alive
- [ ] Education is clear
- [ ] SEO is integrated
- [ ] Story elements present

## LONG-TERM SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

### After Each Episode:

1. **Track What Was Used**
   - Which Kai sounds?
   - Which Vector phrases?
   - Which Recurse actions?
   - What banter patterns?

2. **Note Running Gags**
   - New gags created?
   - Existing gags evolved?
   - Callbacks available?

3. **Plan Next Episode**
   - What to rotate?
   - What to avoid?
   - What to build on?

### Every 10 Episodes:

1. **Review System**
   - Is rotation working?
   - Are characters evolving?
   - Is world expanding?
   - Is story progressing?

2. **Update Files If Needed**
   - Add new sound variations
   - Add new banter patterns
   - Update story timeline
   - Refine environment details

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**The system works when:**
1. You LOAD the files (don't work from memory)
2. You FOLLOW the checklists (don't skip)
3. You ROTATE voices (don't repeat)
4. You INCLUDE banter (don't skip for teaching)
5. You BUILD environment (don't just talk)
6. You DEVELOP characters (don't keep static)

**The system fails when:**
1. You skip loading files
2. You ignore checklists
3. You repeat recent phrases
4. You prioritize teaching over character
5. You forget environment
6. You make characters generic

## REMEMBER

**This is NOT about:**
- Making it complex
- Following rigid rules
- Sacrificing quality for system
- Losing the heart of the story

**This IS about:**
- Reducing repetition (variety)
- Building depth (character growth)
- Expanding world (environment)
- Balancing education and story
- Making characters feel ALIVE
