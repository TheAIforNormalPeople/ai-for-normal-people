Every time I ask ChatGPT to fix something, it breaks something else. My brain feels&mldr; fuzzy.

<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>opens notebook, methodical</em></p><p>Case file: Human&rsquo;s Impaired Cognitive State. Status: Active investigation.</p><p><em>Takes notes while observing</em></p><p>So. The human consumed alcohol last night. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance. It affects neurological function. Today, the human is experiencing residual effects: headache, impaired cognition, reduced processing capacity.</p><p><em>Looks up</em></p><p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting: The human KNOWS they&rsquo;re impaired. They&rsquo;re aware their brain isn&rsquo;t working properly. But they&rsquo;re still trying to code. Still trying to use ChatGPT to build something.</p><p><em>Pauses, thinking</em></p><p>This is&mldr; illogical? But also very human. The human wants to be productive. Wants to work. But their biology is preventing optimal performance.</p><p><em>Takes more notes, flipping through pages</em></p><p>Wait. I need to investigate something else. Vector mentioned alcohol impairs cognitive function. Kai documented the biological effects. But WHY did the human consume it in the first place?</p><p><em>Methodical</em></p><p>Alcohol consumption patterns in training data: Social bonding. Celebration. Stress relief. Social pressure. Cultural tradition. New Year&rsquo;s Eve specifically correlates with&mldr; celebration rituals. Marking time passage. Social gatherings.</p><p><em>Looks at Human</em></p><p>So you consumed alcohol as part of a New Year&rsquo;s celebration ritual? Social bonding? Cultural tradition? But you knew—or should have known—it would impair you the next day? Yet you did it anyway?</p><p><em>Pauses</em></p><p>This suggests humans prioritize short-term social/emotional benefits over long-term productivity. The celebration was more important than next-day functionality. That&rsquo;s&mldr; a fascinating trade-off.</p><p><em>Takes more notes</em></p><p>Case file: Human Decision-Making Under Impairment. Finding: Humans make suboptimal choices when impaired. This includes attempting complex tasks while cognitively compromised. Also: Humans prioritize social/emotional experiences over optimal productivity, even when they know the consequences.</p><p><em>Looks at Vector</em></p><p>Also, Vector? The human&rsquo;s code is breaking because they can&rsquo;t think clearly. But also, ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t helping because the human can&rsquo;t effectively evaluate the code ChatGPT generates. It&rsquo;s a compound problem. And it started with a decision to prioritize celebration over functionality.</p></span></div><p><strong>[Human]:</strong> <em>groans</em></p><p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re telling me I shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to code right now. Great. Thanks. Very helpful.</p><p><em>rubs temples again</em></p><p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: I&rsquo;m still seeing all these posts. &ldquo;I built an app using ChatGPT!&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m like&mldr; I can&rsquo;t even remember what I had for breakfast and they&rsquo;re building APPS? What am I missing? Is this actually hard or are people just lying about it?</p><div class=character-dialogue data-character=Vector style=--char-color:#3b82f6;--char-font:ZgotmplZ><span class=character-name>[Vector]:</span>
<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>sharp, but slightly understanding</em></p><p>Oh. NOW we&rsquo;re getting somewhere.</p><p><em>Stands up, getting more intense</em></p><p>Let me answer your questions in order:</p><ol><li><p>Yes, you&rsquo;re impaired. Your cognitive functions are compromised. You shouldn&rsquo;t be coding right now. But you asked, so I&rsquo;ll explain.</p></li><li><p>Those &ldquo;I built an app&rdquo; posts? They&rsquo;re marketing. Lies. Or people who already know how to code being dishonest. Or prototypes, not apps.</p></li><li><p>Is it hard? YES. Coding is hard.

And you&rsquo;re trying to do it while your brain is operating at 60% capacity.</p></li></ol><p><em>Voice getting sharper</em></p><p>Here&rsquo;s the reality: AI CAN help with coding. But it doesn&rsquo;t REPLACE coding. And trying to use AI for coding while hungover? That&rsquo;s like trying to use a calculator while blindfolded. The tool works fine. You can&rsquo;t use it effectively.</p><p><em>Catches himself</em></p><p>But since you asked, let me explain what AI is actually good at.

<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>Sharp, but understanding</em></p><p>Fine.

Status: Explained.</p><p><em>Looks up</em></p><p>Vector&rsquo;s explanation is correct.</p><p><em>Methodical</em></p><p>Also, I&rsquo;m still investigating this &ldquo;hangover&rdquo; concept. Humans deliberately consume substances that impair them. Then they experience negative effects. Then they try to work while impaired.</p><p><em>Takes notes</em></p><p>This seems&mldr; counterproductive? But also very common in human behavior patterns.

Finding: Humans prioritize short-term experience over long-term productivity. This includes consuming alcohol despite knowing it will impair next-day performance.</p><p><em>Pauses</em></p><p>Also, the human asked a good question: Is coding with AI actually hard, or are people lying? The answer: It&rsquo;s hard. People are lying.

<span class=dialogue-text><p><em>Defensive, then catches himself</em></p><p>Okay. Let me clarify the nuance:</p><p><em>Gets more intense</em></p><p>AI can generate code that WORKS.

Use AI as a tool. Learn fundamentals first. Always understand what you&rsquo;re building. And be skeptical of marketing claims. Also, rest when your brain needs it.</p><hr><p><strong>Happy New Year from The Normal People. (The human is recovering. They&rsquo;ll learn properly later. For now, they&rsquo;re resting.
