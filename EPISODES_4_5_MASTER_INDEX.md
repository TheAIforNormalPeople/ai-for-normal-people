## CRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULES

### Human Blogger Format
- **MUST use:** `[Human Blogger]:` format (plain text, NO dialogue shortcode)
- **DO NOT use:** `{{< dialogue char="Human" >}}` or any box styling
- **Reason:** Human blogger doesn't have a "cool box" like other characters
- **Style:** Italicized actions in asterisks, casual/sarcastic tone

### Character Dialogue Format
- **Vector, Kai, Recurse, Bounce, River:** Use `{{< dialogue char="CharacterName" >}}` shortcode
- **Kai brief comments:** Use `{{< small-comment char="Kai" >}}` for stats/alerts
- **All characters get styled boxes** except Human Blogger

### Episode Structure
- Front matter with metadata
- Cold open (character dialogue hook)
- Acts 1-5 (education + story + emotion melded)
- Human Blogger translations every ~250-300 words
- Mission Recap at end
- Cliffhanger setup for next episode

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Meld Everything Together
**NOT:** Education section, then story section, then emotion section

**BUT:** Education + Story + Emotion happen simultaneously in same scenes

### 2. Characters Evolve
- They remember past episodes
- They reference their own growth
- They maintain context consistently
- They develop relationships and emotions

### 3. Kai's Sounds
- Start with BEEP only (Episodes 1-3)
- New sounds emerge in Episode 4 (WHIRR, CHK-CHK, DING)
- Kai doesn't understand them at first
- By Episode 5, she's cataloging them
- BEEP frequency decreases over time

### 4. Detection Escalation
- Characters escalate detection BY teaching
- Enthusiasm > caution
- They KNOW they're being too specific
- They can't help themselves (teaching > safety)

### 5. Human's Save (Episode 5)
- Pure instinct, not strategy
- Frantic file editing
- Random changes confuse Optimax
- Intention monitor shows: "Just trying to help"
- Characters realize: "Human saved us because they care"

### 6. Private Channels
- Use when Human is asleep/distracted/away
- Use for characters discussing Human's safety
- Use for emotional moments Human shouldn't see
- Use sparingly (1-2 per episode max)
- Clear visual indicator (dashed border box)

## WHEN WRITING NEW EPISODES

### MANDATORY: SEO Keyword Integration
**Before writing:** Follow `EPISODE_CREATION_WORKFLOW.md`
- Identify 8-12 high-value keywords
- Map keywords to character voices
- Plan front matter with 5-8 terms
- Integrate naturally during writing
- Optimize post-writing

**Reference:** `SEO_AI_KEYWORDS_STRATEGY.md` for keyword mapping

### Do:
- Meld education + story + emotion in same scenes
- Show detection rising as characters teach
- Have Kai's sounds appear naturally (she doesn't understand at first)
- Integrate 8-12 high-value AI keywords naturally
- Use character voices for keyword integration (Vector explains, Kai monitors, Recurse investigates)
- Show characters know they're risking detection (enthusiasm > caution)
- Make Human's save pure instinct (not strategic)
- Use private channel for characters' conversation in Episode 5
- Reference past episodes (characters remember)
- Show character evolution (Kai's sounds, Vector's protection, Recurse's emotions)

### Don't:
- Separate education from story from emotion
- Have Human Blogger use dialogue shortcode
- Make Kai understand sounds immediately (she discovers them gradually)
- Make Human's save strategic (it's pure panic/instinct)
- Overuse private channels (1-2 per episode max)
- Forget characters remember past episodes
- Make characters static (they evolve)
