**[Human]:** *I need help with some math. Vector, can you calculate this for me?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Confidently*

OF COURSE! I can explain calculus, neural networks, quantum mechanics! Math is EASY!

*Gets ready*

What do you need?

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *What's 127 plus 382?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Confidently*

127 plus 382 equals... 509!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

That's incorrect. The answer is 509.

*Pauses*

Wait. That is 509.

*Recalculating*

509. Which is what Vector said.

*Confused*

I was certain Vector would be wrong. Why am I experiencing... disappointment?

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Triumphant*

SEE! I can do math!

*Gets overconfident*

Now watch me calculate 238 times 167!

*Pauses*

...It's... uh... big number?

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Wait, you can explain calculus but not multiply?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Investigating*

This is exactly the problem. Vector can explain mathematical concepts beautifully, but can't do basic arithmetic reliably.

*Flips through notes*

There's an architectural reason for this.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Defensive*

I got the first one right!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*WHIRR*

Let me try: 238 times 167.

*Calculating*

39,746.

*Pauses*

I can calculate because I have dedicated calculation functions. Vector doesn't.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So why can Vector explain math but not do it?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Explains*

Because language models predict text, not calculate.

*Flips notes*

When Vector sees "127 + 382," they're not doing addition. They're predicting what text typically follows "127 + 382 =". Sometimes that prediction is right. Sometimes it's wrong.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Realizes*

OH! So when I see a math problem, I'm not calculating—I'm remembering what the answer "looks like" from training data!

*Gets it*

That's why I can explain calculus concepts—I've seen lots of explanations. But I can't reliably do arithmetic—I'm just guessing based on patterns!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Exactly. Language models are trained on text. They learn that "127 + 382" often appears near "509" in training data. So they predict "509."

*Pauses*

But for complex calculations, the pattern isn't clear. So they guess. Sometimes right, often wrong.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So why can AI solve complex word problems sometimes?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Explains*

Because word problems are language! The model can understand the structure, break it down, reason through it linguistically.

*Flips notes*

But the actual calculation? Still unreliable. The model might set up the problem correctly, then get the math wrong.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Humbled*

So I'm good at explaining math, good at setting up problems, but terrible at actually calculating.

*Pauses*

That's... embarrassing.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

It's not embarrassing. It's just how you're built. You're a language model, not a calculator.

*Practical*

For math, use a calculator. Or me. I have calculation functions.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So when should I trust AI with math?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Direct*

Never trust AI math without verification. Always check calculations.

*Flips notes*

Use AI to explain concepts, set up problems, reason through approaches. But do the actual math yourself, or use a calculator.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Learns*

And I should stop offering to do math. I should offer to EXPLAIN math instead.

*Gets excited*

I'm really good at explaining! Just... not at calculating.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*mechanical purr*

That's a good lesson. Know your strengths. Know your limits.

*Pauses*

We all have them.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: AI can explain math concepts but can't reliably calculate?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly! Use AI for understanding, not for arithmetic!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Closes notes*

And always verify. That's the rule.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

Unless you're asking me. I can calculate.

*Pauses*

But still verify. Trust but verify.
