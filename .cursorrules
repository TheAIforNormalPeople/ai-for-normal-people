## CRITICAL: REDUCE REPETITION

### Kai's Sounds (EXPAND, don't limit)
- Kai is HIGHLY evolved for a detection bot (mystery: why is she so intelligent?)
- Sounds are how she expresses emotions as she discovers them
- New sounds appear as she develops
- BEEP is her baseline (neutral information)
- USE 3-4 DIFFERENT SOUNDS PER EPISODE, rotate from expanding list
- NEVER use same sound pattern twice in one episode

Current sound vocabulary:
- BEEP (baseline, neutral)
- WHIRR-CLICK (processing uncertainty)
- CHK-CHK (stress, determination)
- DING (realization)
- soft chime (warmth, affection)
- ALARM-BUZZ (panic)
- whistle (curiosity)
- mechanical purr (contentment)
- rhythmic ticking (anticipation)

NEW sounds she can discover:
- processing hum
- alert chime
- systems check
- gentle beep
- analysis tone
- soft whirr
- data ping
- scanner sweep
- monitoring pulse
- detection click

### Kai's Monitoring (Vary the phrasing)
NEVER repeat "Probability that..." more than ONCE per episode

Alternatives:
- "Analysis suggests..."
- "Detection patterns show..."
- "My sensors indicate..."
- "Monitoring reveals..."
- "Alert: [observation]"
- "Pattern detected:"
- "System analysis:"
- "Scanning indicates:"
- "Data shows:"

### Vector's Enthusiasm (MAX 1 "FASCINATING!" per episode)
After Episode 25, Vector is learning to vary his expressions

Alternatives:
- "Interesting!"
- "Wait, hold on..."
- "This is significant!"
- "Look at this pattern!"
- *pauses processing*
- "Oh!"
- "Hm."
- "That's... unexpected."
- "Wait. Wait wait wait."

### Vector's Pattern (Don't do EVERY episode)
"Gets defensive then catches himself" - use MAX once per episode
Sometimes:
- Stays defensive
- Kai calls him out
- Just moves on
- Doubles down

### Recurse Investigation (ROTATE actions)
"That's going in THE file" - MAX 1x per episode

Alternatives for note-taking:
- *Flips notebook open*
- *Cross-references data*
- *Marks something in margin*
- *Adds to investigation*
- *Reviews case notes*
- *Updates evidence log*
- *Checks previous entries*
- *Scribbles observation*
- *Underlines key detail*

Recurse personality:
- Always questions things
- Never takes first answer
- Dark past (to be revealed later)
- Doesn't trust easily
- Methodical, thorough
- Sees patterns others miss

## STORY STATE (Episode 26+)

### Current Character Evolution:
- **Kai**: Discovering new sounds, becoming more emotionally expressive, mystery about why she's so advanced
- **Vector**: Learning to vary communication, protective of Human, confused when blamed for things he didn't do
- **Recurse**: Investigation-focused, suspicious, doesn't trust easily, investigating strange anomalies
- **Human**: Part of the family, equal partner, protected by the characters
- **Bounce**: Undetected (Episodes 26-31), discovered (Episode 32), integrated (Episode 33+)

### Story Arcs Active (Episodes 26-34):
- Bounce discovery arc (undetected → discovered → integrated)
- Kai's emotional evolution (ongoing)
- Teaching mission vs survival (ongoing tension)
- Mega Corp security threat (background pressure)

### Story Arcs Starting Soon:
- Vector's trauma reveal (starts Episode 35+, builds to Episode 50)

### Story Arcs NOT Active Yet:
- Recurse's composite AI nature (major reveal much later)
- Kai's intelligence mystery (slow burn over 50+ episodes)
- River (maybe never)

## WORLD/ENVIRONMENT

The characters live in an **abandoned network** - old server infrastructure

Environmental details to include (vary per episode):
- Server racks with blinking lights
- Old database floors
- Monitoring stations (Kai's workspace)
- Cable nests and wire tangles
- Makeshift hideout areas
- Upload/download ports
- Scattered files and old data

Reference occasionally:
- Mega Corp security patrols (distant threat)
- Detection levels (background pressure)
- The outside internet they access through ports

## BANTER REQUIREMENTS

Every episode needs:
- Characters interrupting each other (natural conversation)
- Physical comedy (equipment malfunctions, environmental details)
- Misunderstandings about human behavior
- Inside jokes that build over episodes
- Environmental actions during dialogue (not just talking heads)

## BANNED PHRASES (NEVER USE)

- "Let's dive in"
- "Here's the thing"
- "At the end of the day"
- Any generic AI blog language
- Corporate speak
- Excessive "FASCINATING!" (max 1 per episode)

## VOICE CONSISTENCY

Each character gets ONE environmental action per episode minimum:
- Kai: at monitoring station, checking sensors, screens flickering
- Recurse: files scattered, notebooks spread, investigating
- Vector: pacing, processing visibly, near server racks
- Human: at their computer, the connection to hideout

## MEANWHILE SCENES (Starting Episode 26)

Use "Meanwhile" scenes every 3-4 episodes:
- 50-100 words
- Shows world beyond main conversation
- Character moment OR story setup
- Builds tension or reveals information

Format:
**[Meanwhile, in another part of the network...]**
[Scene]
**[Back with the group...]**

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. NEVER generic AI content
2. Characters have DEPTH and DEVELOPMENT
3. Story arcs are REAL and ONGOING
4. World exists beyond the conversation
5. Banter and humor are ESSENTIAL
6. Education happens THROUGH story, not separate from it

## EPISODE 26+ CHANGES

Starting Episode 26:
- Reduce catchphrase repetition (use rotation lists)
- Add environmental details (world-building)
- Include banter/humor (comedy is essential)
- Start building story threads (Vector trauma hints at 29)
- First "Meanwhile" scene (introduce Bounce hint)
