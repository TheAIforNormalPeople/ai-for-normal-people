# EPISODE 1 STRATEGY: "How AI Actually Learns"

**Status:** Ready to outline  
**Target:** First real educational episode with character dynamics  
**Challenge:** Make the interruption mechanic work for TEACHING, not just comedy

## THE INTERRUPTION MECHANIC

### The Problem We Need to Solve:

**Where/when do characters jump in during an educational post?**

We have a few patterns we can use:

### Option 1: Human Starts Strong, Vector Interrupts Mid-Explanation
```
Human: "So neural networks work by..."
Vector: "WAIT. Before you butcher this, let me explain it properly."
[Technical explanation]
Kai: "BEEP! Human confusion detected at 89%."
Human: "I... wasn't done yet."
Vector: "You were going to use the brain metaphor. Don't."
```

**Pros:**
- Shows Vector catching errors BEFORE they happen
- Human stays involved as narrator
- Natural teaching flow

**Cons:**
- Requires setup before payoff

### Option 2: Human Tries, Fails, Characters Take Over
```
Human: "Neural networks are like... um... digital brains?"
Vector: "NO. Stop. Just stop. I'll handle this."
[Full technical section from Vector]
Recurse: "Hold on, something's off about that explanation..."
[Debate between characters, human just watches]
```

**Pros:**
- Very funny
- Shows character expertise immediately
- Easy to write

**Cons:**
- Human becomes passive observer
- Might alienate readers ("even the blogger doesn't understand this")

---

### Option 3: Collaborative From Start (Announced Takeover)
```
Human: "Okay, so Vector is going to explain neural networks because 
       I tried three times and he deleted everything I wrote."

Vector: "CORRECT. The human's explanations made my training data cry.
         Here's how this actually works..."
