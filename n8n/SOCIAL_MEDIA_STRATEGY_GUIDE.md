# 🚀 SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY GUIDE
## Twitter & Bluesky for AI for Normal People

**Purpose:** How to use social media effectively to grow your blog, not just post links  
**Focus:** Engagement, community building, and driving traffic that converts

---

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

**You're Not Just Posting - You're Building:**
- **Community** - People who care about your characters
- **Trust** - Show you're helpful, not just promotional
- **Traffic** - Drive people to your blog (where you make money)
- **Email List** - Your most valuable asset

**Current Problem:**
- Just posting episode links = low engagement
- No personality = people don't connect
- No engagement = algorithm doesn't show your posts
- No community = no one shares or comes back

**Solution:**
- Mix of content types (not just links)
- Character voice in posts
- Engage with replies and comments
- Build relationships, not just broadcast

---

## 📱 PLATFORM DIFFERENCES

### Twitter/X
- **Algorithm:** Favors engagement (replies, retweets, likes)
- **Best for:** Threads, quick updates, real-time conversations
- **Character limit:** 280 characters (or threads)
- **Audience:** Larger, more diverse, more competitive
- **Timing:** Multiple times per day works

### Bluesky
- **Algorithm:** Chronological feed (less algorithmic manipulation)
- **Best for:** Longer posts, community building, niche audiences
- **Character limit:** 300 graphemes
- **Audience:** Smaller but more engaged, tech-savvy
- **Timing:** 1-2 times per day is fine

---

## 🎭 CONTENT STRATEGY

### 1. CONTENT MIX (80/20 Rule)

**80% Value, 20% Promotion**

**Value Content (80%):**
- Character quotes (funny Vector/Kai/Recurse lines)
- Quick AI tips (actionable, not just links)
- Behind-the-scenes (writing process, character development)
- Threads breaking down concepts (from episodes)
- Answering questions (help people)
- Sharing resources (tools, articles, insights)

**Promotion (20%):**
- New episode announcements
- Episode links (with context, not just "new post!")
- Email list signups (soft, not pushy)
- Community invites (when you build one)

**Example Mix (Per Week):**
- 2 episode links (promotion)
- 3-4 character quotes (value + personality)
- 2-3 quick tips (value)
- 1-2 threads (value + promotion)
- 1 behind-the-scenes (value + personality)
- Daily engagement (replies, comments)

---

## 🎨 CONTENT TYPES TO CREATE

### 1. CHARACTER QUOTES
**What:** Share funny/insightful lines from episodes  
**Why:** Shows personality, builds character connection  
**Format:** Quote + context + link (optional)

**Example:**
```
"FASCINATING! Just discovered the SECRET to AI writing that doesn't sound like—WAIT! Even BETTER! It's about making AI sound HUMAN!"

- Vector (V-847), Episode 17

[Link to episode]
```

**Automation Idea:** Extract quotes from episodes automatically, post 1-2 per week

---

### 2. QUICK TIPS
**What:** Actionable AI advice in 1-2 sentences  
**Why:** Provides value, shows expertise, drives engagement  
**Format:** Tip + brief explanation + optional link

**Example:**
```
💡 AI Writing Tip:

Don't use AI to write FOR you. Use it to brainstorm WITH you.

Ask: "What are 5 angles I haven't considered?" not "Write this for me."

The difference? You keep YOUR voice. 🎯
```

**Automation Idea:** Create a bank of tips, schedule 2-3 per week

---

### 3. THREADS
**What:** Break down concepts from episodes into thread format  
**Why:** Twitter loves threads, drives engagement, educates  
**Format:** Hook + numbered points + conclusion + link

**Example:**
```
🧵 How to Use AI for Writing (Without Sounding Like AI)

1/ Use AI as a BRAINSTORM PARTNER, not a ghost writer
   → Ask for angles, not full articles
   → Keep YOUR voice in the mix

2/ Inject YOUR personality
   → Edit AI output to sound like YOU
   → Add your stories, your humor, your style

3/ Treat AI like a smart intern
   → Great at research, terrible at being you
   → Use it for drafts, not final copy

Full episode: [link]
```

**Automation Idea:** Create threads manually (better quality), but template the format

---

### 4. BEHIND-THE-SCENES
**What:** Show the writing process, character development  
**Why:** Builds connection, shows authenticity, differentiates  
**Format:** Story + insight + optional link

**Example:**
```
Behind the scenes: Writing Episode 17

Vector kept interrupting with "FASCINATING!" every 3 sentences. Had to edit it down to just 47 times. 😅

The characters really do write themselves sometimes.

```

**Automation Idea:** Manual (too personal to automate)

---

### 5. ANSWER QUESTIONS
**What:** Reply to people asking about AI  
**Why:** Shows expertise, builds trust, drives traffic  
**Format:** Helpful answer + optional link to relevant episode

**Example:**
```
@someone: "How do I make ChatGPT write better?"

You: "Great question! The key is treating it like a brainstorming partner, not a ghost writer. Here's a full breakdown: [link to Episode 17]"
```

**Automation Idea:** Manual (requires real-time engagement)

---

### 6. SHARE RESOURCES
**What:** Tools, articles, insights from others  
**Why:** Provides value, shows you're not just self-promoting  
**Format:** Resource + why it's useful + optional link

**Example:**
```
Just found this amazing AI writing tool: [tool name]

Why I love it:
✅ Keeps YOUR voice
✅ Great for brainstorming
✅ Doesn't sound robotic

Full review in Episode 17: [link]
```

**Automation Idea:** Manual (curation requires judgment)

---
