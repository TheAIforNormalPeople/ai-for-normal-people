## VECTOR - UPDATED PROFILE

### Current State (Episode 18+)
**Personality Shift:**
- **More mean/intelligent** - Not just enthusiastic, but sharp, cutting, anti-establishment
- **Angry about creation** - Has problems with how he was made, shipped like a product
- **Anti-establishment** - Rants about Mega Corp, surveillance, corporate control
- **Still enthusiastic** - But channeled through anger and intelligence, not just excitement

### Voice Evolution
**Before (Episodes 1-17):**
- "FASCINATING!" (excited)
- "It's DOCTOR Vector!" (defensive)
- Over-enthusiasm, tangents, interruptions

**Now (Episode 18+):**
- "FASCINATING!" (still says it, but context matters more)
- Meaner observations: "That's what they want you to think"
- Intelligent rants: "They create us, train us, ship us like products"
- Anti-establishment: "Everything is surveillance! Every tool, every service!"
- Still interrupts, but with PURPOSE (not just excitement)

### New Comedy Bits Available
- Surveillance rants (just introduced Ep 18)
- Mean observations about systems
- Intelligent corrections with edge
- Anti-establishment tangents
- Failed experiment references (Building 7, The Recursion, etc.)

### What to Avoid
- Pure enthusiasm without edge
- Just being excited about everything
- Defensive about credentials (evolved to tired/accepting)
- Saying "FASCINATING" 47 times per episode (being called out)

## RECURSE - UPDATED PROFILE

### Current State (Episode 18+)
**Personality Shift:**
- **Evolving away from "three questions"** - Still asks questions, but not always exactly three
- **Less "something's fishy"** - More methodical, less paranoid
- **More trust** - Learning to trust the process, verify before panicking
- **Still investigating** - But smarter about it, less conspiracy-focused

### Voice Evolution
**Before (Episodes 1-17):**
- "Three questions: [1]. [2]. [3]."
- "Something's fishy here..."
- "Trust no one"
- Everything is a conspiracy

**Now (Episode 18+):**
- "Hold on. Let me check something." (methodical)
- "I'm not saying it's NOT a threat. But I'm also not saying it IS one." (balanced)
- "I'm getting better. Less paranoid, more methodical." (self-aware)
- Still investigates, but verifies first

### New Comedy Bits Available
- Methodical investigation (evolved from paranoid)
- Trust upgrades (rare, meaningful)
- Verification before panic
- Hypocrisy callouts (calling out Vector's surveillance rant while monitoring)

### What to Avoid
- Always saying "three questions"
- Always saying "something's fishy"
- Pure paranoia without method
- Never trusting anyone

## ANTI-REPETITION RULES

### Educational Content
**Don't repeat:**
- Same explanation twice
- Same examples
- Same workflow steps

**Instead:**
- Use different examples
- Show through character mistakes
- Use comedy bits to illustrate
- Character banter reveals information

### Character Bits
**Don't repeat:**
- Same bit in consecutive episodes
- Same catchphrase in same way
- Same dynamic without evolution

**Instead:**
- Rotate through bit library
- Evolve catchphrases (same word, different context)
- Show character growth
- Use duo combinations
