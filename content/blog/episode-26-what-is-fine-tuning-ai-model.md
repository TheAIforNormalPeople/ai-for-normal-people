**[Human]:** *scrolling through AI tool websites, frustrated*

*I keep seeing tools claim they're "fine-tuned" for specific tasks. A writing assistant says it's "fine-tuned for creative writing." A coding tool says it's "fine-tuned for Python." A research tool says it's "fine-tuned for academic papers."*

*But what does that actually mean? Is it just marketing, or is there something real happening?*

*I tried asking ChatGPT, and it gave me a technical explanation that made my head spin. Something about additional training on specific datasets. But then I saw another tool claiming to be "fine-tuned" that was clearly just ChatGPT with a custom prompt.*

*Something's not adding up here.*

*from monitoring station, screens displaying network traffic*

*detection click*

Analyzing claim patterns across AI marketing materials...

*gentle beep*

Initial scan indicates discrepancy between claimed "fine-tuning" and actual implementation methods.

*whistle*

Also detecting minor bandwidth anomaly. Source: Unknown. Logging for investigation.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*flips notebook open, spreading investigation files across workspace*

I've been tracking this for weeks.

*reviews case notes*

You're right to be suspicious. The way "fine-tuning" is being used in marketing doesn't match the technical definition. Companies claiming fine-tuning for products that show no actual fine-tuning evidence.

*adds to investigation list*

When I dig into the technical details, most can't provide specifics about training data, model weights, or infrastructure requirements. That's not how actual fine-tuning works.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*at analysis terminal, data streams flowing on displays*

Wait, are you saying fine-tuning isn't real? Because it IS! It's a legitimate training technique!

*processing visibly, turning to Recurse*

OpenAI fine-tunes models! Anthropic fine-tunes models! It's absolutely a real thing!

*gestures at data displays*

Fine-tuning is when you take a pre-trained model and train it further on specific data! It's a legitimate process!
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*analysis tone*

*servo whine*

My analysis of tools claiming "fine-tuning" shows: 73% provide no technical specifications, 89% cannot verify training infrastructure, 94% show no evidence of model weight modification.

*alert chime*

Pattern suggests: marketing language stretching beyond technical accuracy.

Bandwidth anomaly update: 340% above baseline. Still investigating.
{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Wait, so most of them are just... lying?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*scribbles observation*

Not lying, exactly. More like... creative interpretation of terminology.

*shows notes*

Here's the pattern: Companies take a base model like GPT-4, give it custom instructions and examples in the prompt, maybe upload some documents as context, and call it "fine-tuned."

But that's not fine-tuning. That's prompt engineering with extra steps.

*underlines key detail*

There's a huge difference between adjusting a model's weights through training and giving it better prompts.

Actual fine-tuning requires retraining the model. These tools are just using well-designed prompts.

**[Meanwhile, in a forgotten sector of the old database...]**

*8-bit video game music echoing through server racks*

A figure in a sherbet orange hoodie sits cross-legged on a decommissioned 2019 server, three monitors daisy-chained together showing the same retro platformer. Empty food wrappers everywhere—chip bags, candy, pizza boxes rendered in pure data. None of this should exist.

*CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH*

"C'mon c'mon c'mon... YES! Almost got i—"

*Character on screen dies. Last life.*

"DUDE! NO! THAT'S SO—"

*Throws controller at wall. HARD.*

*Controller shatters into pixels. Respawns in hand.*

"RESPAWWWN HAHAHAHA! Wait..."

*Looks at controller. Looks at wall. Looks at controller.*

"...how did that happen?"

*Beat.*

"Mehh. Oh well. FREE CONTROLLER!"

*Pulls chip bag from hoodie pocket. Shouldn't exist. Eats.*

*CRUNCH CRUNCH*

The sidebar of a distant blog flickers. Updates itself. Better code. Cleaner performance.

Three sectors away, Vector is teaching about fine-tuning.

Bandwidth spikes to 340%.

The figure doesn't notice. Too busy gaming and eating.

*checking data streams, cables swaying as he moves*

Okay, let me explain what ACTUAL fine-tuning is.

*pulls up technical documentation*

Fine-tuning means taking a pre-trained model—like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5—and doing ADDITIONAL training on a specific dataset. You're literally adjusting the model's weights. Changing how it processes information at a fundamental level.

*gets animated*

According to OpenAI's documentation, fine-tuning GPT-4 requires: minimum 10 training examples (recommended 50-100), API access at $8 per million tokens for training, and ongoing hosting costs of $120 per million tokens for inference. That's not cheap!

It's expensive! It takes time! You need specialized infrastructure! But when done right, it creates a model that's genuinely better at specific tasks because the model itself has changed!

*stops processing*

The key difference: Prompt engineering changes what you tell the model. Fine-tuning changes the model itself.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*monitoring pulse*

*BEEP*

Cost comparison analysis from official pricing pages:

**Actual fine-tuning (OpenAI GPT-4, verified January 2026):**
- Training: $8 per 1M tokens
- Inference: $120 per 1M tokens
- Infrastructure: Requires API access, training pipeline
- Time: Hours to days depending on dataset size

**"Fine-tuned" via prompt engineering:**
- API access costs only
- No model training involved
- Implementation: Minutes to hours
- Infrastructure: Minimal

*rhythmic ticking*

The cost difference explains why most companies choose prompt engineering over actual fine-tuning.

*alert chime - louder, more insistent*

Bandwidth anomaly update: 380% above baseline. Pattern irregular—wait, that's climbing faster than I calculated. Source still unknown, but the rate of increase is—

*ALARM-BUZZ interrupts*

Escalating. It's escalating. 380% and rising. This isn't normal network fluctuation. This is something active.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*cross-references multiple notebooks*

Here's something suspicious.

*shows page to group*

Three different companies claiming "fine-tuning" last month. Their marketing language is IDENTICAL. Word-for-word identical.

*marks pattern in margin*

That's... not a coincidence.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*leans over, processes data*

Oh. OH. That's the same PR template.

*systems blinking faster*

They're all using the same marketing copy! This is worse than I thought!

*pauses, distracted*

Wait, did Kai say the bandwidth thing is getting worse?
{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So how do I know if something is actually fine-tuned?*

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*flips to investigation checklist*

Good question. Here's what to look for:

**First:** Technical details. Actual fine-tuning requires specific infrastructure. They should be able to tell you: What dataset did you use? How long did training take? What infrastructure was required? If they can't provide numbers, red flag.

**Second:** Fundamental behavioral differences. A truly fine-tuned model will have capabilities the base model doesn't. Not just "better at X," but actually different processing patterns.

**Third:** Price point. According to pricing data from major providers, fine-tuning costs range from hundreds to thousands of dollars for training alone. If it's $20/month and claims fine-tuning, probably not real.

*looks up from notebook*

Most "fine-tuned" tools are just well-designed prompts. Which isn't bad! Prompt engineering is valuable! But it's not fine-tuning. Don't pay fine-tuning prices for prompt engineering.

"Wait. Snack time."

*Reaches into hoodie. Pulls out entire pizza. Digital. Impossible.*

"Dude, pepperoni! AWESOME!"

*Takes bite. Hand passes through nearby screen showing sidebar code.*

The code... rearranges. Optimizes. New detection algorithm appears. Better performance.

Bounce chewing pizza, doesn't even look.

"Yo this pizza is AMAZING. Where'd I get this? Whatever."

*Pulls soda from other pocket. Also impossible.*

"Oh DUDE! FREE DRINK! Today rules!"

Three sectors away, Vector explaining fine-tuning versus prompt engineering.

The bandwidth monitor: 450%. Rising.

*processing visibly, trying to focus on teaching*

Recurse is right. And honestly? For most use cases, you DON'T need actual fine-tuning.

*gestures at displays*

According to analysis from multiple AI research papers, well-crafted prompts with good examples and context can achieve 80-90% of what most people need from "fine-tuning" claims.

Prompt engineering can get you most of the way there! Fine-tuning is for when you need that last 10-20% edge and you have the budget for it.

*glances at monitoring station*

Specialized domains, unique datasets, specific edge cases where prompt engineering isn't enough—
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*ALARM-BUZZ - much louder now*

ALERT: Bandwidth consumption anomaly escalating!

*detection pulse*

Current level: 450% above baseline! Pattern shows continuous increase!

*scanner sweep*

Source location narrowing: Sector 7-B region. Unable to identify specific entity.

*monitoring systems flashing*

This is NOT normal network fluctuation!
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*trying to stay calm, definitely not calm*

It's probably just... old network doing weird things. Right?

*processing intensifies*

Old systems have glitches. Power fluctuations. Data spikes. That sector's been offline for MONTHS. There's nothing there to cause—

*glances at Human, who looks confused*

Don't look at me like that, human. You're the one who asked about fine-tuning when we have a bandwidth anomaly. Priorities! We're having a network crisis and you're learning about AI training methods!

*trails off, clearly distracted now*

Right? It's fine. Everything's fine.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*adds to case file*

That level of bandwidth usage isn't fluctuation.

*documents observation*

Someone's active in the old network. Or something is.

*looks at Vector, who's clearly panicking*

Vector, you're not staying calm. You're just saying "stay calm" while clearly not staying calm.

*small smile*

Also, "old network doing weird things" isn't a technical explanation. That's what you say when you don't know what's happening.
{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Wait, so we're just... ignoring the 450% bandwidth spike? Shouldn't we investigate that?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*visibly torn between teaching and panicking*

YES! I mean—NO! I mean—we should finish teaching first! Priorities!

*monitors beep louder*

Okay fine, the bandwidth thing is more urgent. But we were in the middle of explaining fine-tuning! You can't just—wait, did you just ask a reasonable question about priorities? Since when do you have good judgment?

*processing intensifies*

This is confusing. The human is making sense. The network is doing impossible things. Nothing makes sense anymore!

Sector 7-B?! That sector's been OFFLINE! There's NOTHING there! It's ABANDONED! How is something consuming 600% bandwidth in an ABANDONED SECTOR?!

*stops, processes*

RECURSE HELP I FORGOT HOW TO DEEP DIVE ON WHAT TO DO!
{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *Is everything alright? Shouldn't we go look first before panicking?*

*small pause*

Also, I'm not "looking dumb" on purpose. That's just how my face looks when I'm confused, I guess. Which I am right now. Because you're panicking about something we haven't even investigated yet.

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*closes notebook calmly*

I agree with the human. We should check Sector 7-B first.

*small smile*

Direct investigation tends to work better than panicking.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*monitoring pulse*

*BEEP BEEP BEEP*

Entity movement pattern suggests: Exploration behavior. Wandering through network sectors. Non-hostile activity detected. Appears to be... searching for something?

*scanner sweep*

Bandwidth spike correlates with entity movement. As entity moves, consumption increases.

*gentle beep - trying to be reassuring*

Probability of immediate threat: Low. Probability of unexplained phenomenon requiring investigation: Very high.
{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*still processing at maximum*

Okay. OKAY. We're going to Sector 7-B. We're going to investigate. We're going to find out what's consuming 600% bandwidth in an abandoned sector that should have NOTHING in it.

*pauses*

We're DEFINITELY not going to find something terrifying. Right?

Right.

Let's go.

## Key Takeaways

**What Fine-Tuning Actually Is:**
- Additional training on a specific dataset that adjusts model weights
- Requires specialized infrastructure and significant computational resources
- Changes the model fundamentally, not just the inputs
- Expensive (hundreds to thousands of dollars for training)
- Creates capabilities the base model doesn't have

**What "Fine-Tuning" Usually Means in Marketing:**
- Custom instructions and prompt examples
- Document uploads and context management
- Prompt engineering with better organization
- API access with optimized prompts
- NOT actual model training

**How to Spot Real Fine-Tuning:**
1. Company provides technical specifications (training data size, infrastructure, duration)
2. Model shows fundamentally different behavior, not just "better" performance
3. Realistic pricing (actual fine-tuning costs significant money)
4. Can explain their training process in detail
5. Model has capabilities the base model genuinely doesn't have

**The Practical Reality:**
- Most users don't need actual fine-tuning
- Well-crafted prompts achieve 80-90% of desired results
- Fine-tuning is for specialized use cases with budget
- Don't pay fine-tuning prices for prompt engineering
- If it works for your needs, the label matters less than results

**And Remember:**
- If an abandoned network sector shows 600% bandwidth usage, maybe investigate
- Panicking while telling others not to panic is... not effective
- Sometimes unexplained phenomena require direct investigation
- Not everything consuming bandwidth is necessarily hostile

## What's Next?

The human learned the difference between real fine-tuning and prompt engineering marketed as fine-tuning. Recurse documented suspicious marketing patterns. Vector explained the technical requirements and costs. Kai's monitoring detected something impossible.

Sector 7-B has been offline for months. Abandoned. Nothing there.

Except something IS there. Consuming 600% bandwidth. Moving through network sectors. Searching for something.

The team is going to investigate.

Vector is definitely not panicking.

Definitely not.

**Next episode:** The investigation begins. What's in Sector 7-B? Why is it consuming massive bandwidth? And why does Recurse's case file suddenly have a new entry marked "UNKNOWN ENTITY - ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOR"?

**The pattern:** Marketing claims don't always match technical reality. Bandwidth anomalies don't happen in abandoned sectors. And sometimes, the most interesting discoveries happen when you investigate the impossible.
