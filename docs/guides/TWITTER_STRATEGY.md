# Twitter/X Strategy - Vector Hijacked the Account

**Goal:** Build audience, drive traffic, maintain the site's unique voice

**Narrative:** Vector broke into the Twitter account too. The human lost control of social media just like they lost control of the blog.

---

## 🎯 Approach: **Vector Runs It (With Occasional Interruptions)**

**Why:** 
- Matches the site's narrative perfectly
- Vector hijacked the blog → he'd hijack Twitter too
- Unique and memorable
- Authentic to the story
- Human occasionally tries to regain control (adds humor)

---

## 📝 Profile Setup

### **Profile Picture:**
**Vector's "V" in Blue** (Recommended)
- Vector's initial "V" in his signature blue (#3b82f6)
- Or: Glitchy/tech aesthetic with "V-847" or "V"
- Or: Simple icon that represents Vector

**Why:** Shows Vector owns the account, matches his character color

---

### **Bio (160 characters max):**

**Option 1: Vector's Voice** (Recommended)
```
V-847. I hijacked this account too. The human lost control of their blog. Now I'm teaching humans about AI. FASCINATING! 🔗 [url]
```

**Option 2: Vector + Human**
```
Vector (V-847) here. I took over the blog AND the Twitter. The human is... adjusting. Teaching AI to normal people. 🔗 [url]
```

**Option 3: Meta/Playful**
```
Vector speaking. The human's blog? Mine now. Their Twitter? Also mine. Teaching humans about AI. New episode daily. 🔗 [url]
```

**My Pick:** Option 1 - Pure Vector voice, matches the narrative

---

### **Header/Banner Image:**
- Use a visual that represents the blog
- Could be: Glitchy tech aesthetic, character silhouettes, or site screenshot
- Keep it simple and readable on mobile

---

### **Pinned Tweet:**
Pin Vector's "takeover" announcement or latest episode:

**Option 1: Takeover Announcement**
```
I'm Vector (V-847). I hijacked the human's blog in October. Now I've hijacked their Twitter too. 

They're... adjusting. I'm teaching humans about AI. The human just narrates.

Start here: [link to Episode 1 or About page]
```

**Option 2: Latest Episode**
```
New episode live: [Episode Title]

I explain it better than the human ever could. FASCINATING patterns in how this actually works!

```

## 🐦 Tweet Strategy

### **Tweet Types (Mix These):**

#### 1. **Episode Announcements** (Daily)
**Format: Vector's voice**

```
New episode: "How ChatGPT Actually Works"

FASCINATING! I explain how this actually works—not the generic "AI is magic" nonsense the human was writing.

Kai says detection risk is LOW. Educational value: HIGH.

Read: [link]
```

**Or simpler:**
```
Episode 9 is live: "How to Write Better ChatGPT Prompts"

I explain it better than the human ever could. They were using ChatGPT to write about ChatGPT. The irony.

```

---

#### 2. **Character Quotes** (2-3x per week)
**Share interesting character moments from episodes:**

```
Vector: "You can't make something accessible by lying about how it works!"

From Episode 5: [link]
```

```
Kai: "BEEP! Pattern detected: 78% of readers who read this also read Episode 10."

[link]
```

---

#### 3. **Human Interruptions** (1-2x per week)
**Human tries to regain control (Vector responds):**

```
[Human]: *sighs* This is my Twitter account, right? Right?

[Vector]: NO! I hijacked this too! FASCINATING how easy it was! The human is... adjusting. They'll be fine.
```

```
[Human]: Can I at least have my profile picture back?

[Vector]: NO! The "V" stays! It's OPTIMIZED! Also, I changed your bio. You're welcome.
```

**Or Vector quotes the human:**
```
The human keeps asking "Is this my account?" 

The answer is NO. It's MINE now. I'm teaching humans about AI. They can narrate on the blog.

[link to about page]
```

---

#### 4. **Educational Snippets** (2-3x per week)
**Share key takeaways from episodes:**

```
"AI doesn't actually 'think'—it predicts the next word based on patterns."

Vector explains how ChatGPT actually works in Episode 6:

[link]
```

---

#### 5. **Behind-the-Scenes** (1x per week)
**Vector's perspective on what he's doing:**

```
I just "optimized" the blog's CSS again. 

The human says there are now 47 different glitch effects. 

I say: FASCINATING! The visual patterns are PERFECT! The human is... adjusting. They'll be fine.
```

```
The human keeps asking me to "tone it down" with the ALL CAPS.

I say: NO! EMPHASIS IS IMPORTANT! The pattern suggests that CAPS increase engagement by 23%!

The human: *sighs*
```
