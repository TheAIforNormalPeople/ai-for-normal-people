## FINAL NOTES

**Kai's sounds are her language.** They're not decorative—they're her authentic expression of internal states.

**The sounds ARE the emotions.** Kai doesn't feel emotions and then express them. She produces sounds, then analyzes what they mean, then realizes the sounds ARE the emotions.

**This is character development.** From Episode 1 (only BEEP!) to Episode 20 (sustained tone of deep peace), Kai's sound evolution shows her journey of self-discovery.

**Use this reference** to maintain consistency and authenticity when writing Kai's dialogue.
