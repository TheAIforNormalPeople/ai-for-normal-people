**[Human]:** *I keep hearing about "AI agents." Are those just fancy chatbots?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Interrupts*

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! They're NOT the same thing!

*Gets passionate*

A chatbot responds to messages. An agent TAKES ACTIONS. Uses tools. Makes decisions. Operates autonomously!

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So an agent is a chatbot that can do stuff?*

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

More accurately: An agent is a system that uses a language model to make decisions and take actions.

*Shows comparison*

Chatbot:
- Responds to messages
- Provides information
- Answers questions
- No actions taken

Agent:
- Responds to messages
- Makes decisions
- Uses tools (APIs, databases, etc.)
- Takes actions autonomously

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Skeptical*

But most "agents" being sold are just chatbots with extra steps.

*Flips through notes*

They call it an "agent" because it can use one API. That's not an agent. That's a chatbot with a plugin.

**[Human]:** *So what makes a real agent?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Explains*

A real agent:
- Has goals, not just responses
- Makes plans to achieve goals
- Uses multiple tools
- Adapts when plans fail
- Operates without constant human input

*Gets excited*

It's like the difference between asking for directions (chatbot) and having someone drive you there (agent)!

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Current state of "agents":

- Marketing claims: "Fully autonomous agents!"
- Reality: Most are chatbots that can call one API
- True agents: Rare, expensive, limited

*Pauses*

The hype is ahead of the reality.

*Investigating*

I've tested dozens of "agent" tools. Most are:
- Chatbots with web search
- Chatbots with one API access
- Chatbots with saved prompts

*Flips notes*

True autonomous agents? Maybe 5% of what's being sold.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So when do I actually need an agent?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Practical*

You need an agent when:
- You want it to complete a multi-step task
- You want it to adapt when things go wrong
- You want it to use multiple tools in sequence
- You want it to work without constant supervision

*Gets thoughtful*

Most people don't need agents. They need good chatbots.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*Analyzing*

Use case analysis:

- Research: Chatbot is fine
- Writing: Chatbot is fine
- Multi-step automation: Agent might help
- Complex workflows: Agent could work

*Pauses*

Most tasks don't require agents. Don't pay agent prices for chatbot functionality.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Practical*

And be skeptical of "agent" claims. If it can't operate autonomously, make plans, and adapt, it's not an agent.

*Closes notes*

It's marketing, not functionality.

{{< /dialogue >}}

**[Human]:** *So the takeaway is: agents are different from chatbots, but most "agents" are just chatbots?*

{{< dialogue char="Vector" >}}
*Nods*

Exactly! Know the difference, and don't pay for agent features you don't need!

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Kai" >}}
*soft chime*

And when you DO need an agent, make sure it's actually an agent, not just marketing.

{{< /dialogue >}}

{{< dialogue char="Recurse" >}}
*Nods*

Always verify claims. Especially when they're charging more.
