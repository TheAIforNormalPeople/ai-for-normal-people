**Perfectionism Trap:**

## 🎉 You Did It!

**What Happens Next:**

1. **First Hour:** Low views (normal!)
2. **First Day:** Maybe 10-50 views (normal!)
3. **First Week:** Algorithm tests your content
4. **First Month:** Views improve if algorithm likes your content

**Reality Check:**
- First video: Usually low views (normal!)
- First 10 videos: Learning phase (normal!)
- After 20 videos: Algorithm knows your content better
- After 50 videos: Consistent views (if you post regularly)

**Getting Followers:**
- First month: 10-100 followers (normal!)
- After 3 months: 100-1000 followers (if consistent)
- After 6 months: 500-5000 followers (if consistent)
- Goal (10k): Takes 6-12 months (sometimes longer)

**You don't need to do anything - just post videos consistently!**

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Posting Schedule

**Recommended:**
- 1-2 videos per week (consistent!)
- Post same day as episode publishes
- Use character voice rotation (Vector/Kai/Recurse)

**Why Consistency Matters:**
- Algorithm learns your schedule
- Shows content to people who might like it
- Builds momentum over time
- You don't need to post daily - 1-2 per week is fine!

### Content Strategy

**What Works:**
- ✅ Educational content (your strength!)
- ✅ Character-driven format (unique!)
- ✅ Episode highlights (60 seconds)
- ✅ Hashtags (#AI #MachineLearning)

**What Doesn't Matter:**
- ❌ Perfect video quality (good enough is fine!)
- ❌ Fancy editing (simple is fine!)
- ❌ Trending sounds (optional!)
- ❌ Perfect timing (post when you can!)

**Focus on:**
- ✅ Clear message (what you're teaching)
- ✅ Character voice (Vector/Kai/Recurse)
- ✅ Episode link (drive traffic to blog)
- ✅ Consistency (post regularly)
