## Clear Goals and Milestones

**Created:** 2025-12-29  
**Purpose:** Define where each character is going, what they'll learn, and how we'll know they've grown

## HOW TO TRACK GROWTH

### After Each Episode:
1. Did character grow? (Even small growth counts)
2. Did they hit a milestone? (Document it)
3. Did they have a setback? (That's okay, growth isn't linear)
4. Did relationships develop? (Document it)
5. Did collective grow? (Document it)

### Growth Indicators:
- **Voice changes:** Less catchphrases, more natural
- **Behavior changes:** New responses to old situations
- **Relationship changes:** Better interactions with others
- **Emotional changes:** More depth, more connection
- **Teaching changes:** Better at helping others

### Red Flags (No Growth):
- Character stays exactly the same
- Same catchphrases in same way
- No relationship development
- No emotional depth
- No teaching improvement
