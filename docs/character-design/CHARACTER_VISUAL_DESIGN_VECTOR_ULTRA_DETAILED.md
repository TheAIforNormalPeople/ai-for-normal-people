## QUICK FEEDBACK GUIDE

**Common feedback and how I'll fix it:**

- "Hat too small" → Increase hat size percentage
- "Face too happy" → Adjust mouth/eyes to be more neutral
- "Not distinctive enough" → Add more details, make animal more prominent
- "Colors wrong" → Specify exact colors you want
- "Animal doesn't look right" → Describe what you want instead
- "Wire hair weird" → Adjust positioning/volume/details
- "Body too simple" → Add more details
